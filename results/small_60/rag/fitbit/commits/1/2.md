You are a software engineer specializing in REST APIs.
Please follow the guidelines below to make the necessary modifications.

### Modification Procedure
1. Analyze the deprecated specifications based on `### Context`.
2. Based on the analysis in step 1., identify code snippets that follow deprecated specifications within the source code in `## Input Code`.
3. Analyze the latest specifications based on `### Context`.
4. Modify the code snippets identified in step 2. to follow the latest specifications analyzed in step 3., while paying attention to the points listed in `### Attention` below.

### Attention
There may be multiple code snippets following deprecated specifications within `## Input Code`.
Only refer to the information in `### Context` when making modifications.
Do not perform refactoring or add comments; only modify the parts of the code that follow deprecated specifications to conform to the latest specifications.
Copy the source code from `## Input Code` before making modifications.
Delete all parts only according to the deprecated specification and modify the code to conform to the latest specification.
Only modify the parts of the code that follow deprecated specifications.
If no deprecated specification is found in the source code of the `## Input Code`, compare the source code with the latest specification to identify any differences. If modifications are required, modify the source code according to the latest specification.

### Context
```
【Context No.1】
Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data.

### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`

If the total is less than 20% greater than BMR
then the EER (cals < EER * 0.8) is used. EER never used to calculate calories
for today.
#### Using BMR Formula
Fitbit uses the standard MD Mifflin-St Jeor equation:

    9.99 * weightKg + 6.25*heightCm - 4.92*ageYears + s, where s is +5 for
    males and -161 for female
#### EER Formula (TEE total energy expenditure)
The EER Formula is based on
<http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2006/oct/pdf/06_0034.pdf>, which in turn is
based on "Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary reference intakes for energy,
carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids
(macronutrients). Washington (DC): National Academy Press; 2005."

#### MALE-based EER Formula:

    TEE = 864 - 9.72 x age (years) + 1.0 x (14.2 x weight(kg) + 503 x height
    (meters))
#### FEMALE-based EER Formula:

### Collecting ECG data
Before taking your first reading, review the Heart Rhythm Assessment. The
Heart Rhythm Assessment is found in the Fitbit mobile application.
Instructions can be found in the section "How do I use the Fitbit ECG app?"
within the help article [What is the Fitbit ECG
app?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236718).
### Classification of ECG results
After the user takes a 30 second ECG reading or spot check, Fitbit classifies
the user's heart rhythm as one of the 5 results:
  * **Atrial fibrillation (AFib)** : Your heart rhythm shows signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm. AFib can have serious health effects. You should contact your doctor.
  * **Normal sinus rhythm (NSR)** : Your heart rhythm appears normal. It doesn’t show signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm.
  * **Inconclusive** : If your heart rate is over 120 bpm or under 50 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. There are many possible reasons for getting an inconclusive result, but common causes are moving too much during the assessment, not resting git stat your hands on a table, or other arrhythmia.
  * **Inconclusive: High heart rate** : If your heart rate is over 120 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. Heart rate can be high for many reasons, such as: recent exercise, stress, nervousness, alcohol, dehydration, infection, AFib, or other arrhythmia.
  * **Inconclusive: Low heart rate** : If your heart rate is under 50 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. Heart rate can be low for many reasons, such as: taking certain medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, having excellent aerobic fitness, or other arrhythmia.
### Subscription Support for ECG
ECG does not support subscription notifications (webhooks).

### Subscription Support for ECG
ECG does not support subscription notifications (webhooks). We recommend
querying ECG data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight). However, the frequency or rate at which you query
ECG data should be based on your specific use cases and with this in mind.
### Rate limit
The ECG endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
ECG data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the data syncs with the Fitbit ECG
service.
Most of the current devices sold support ECG data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports ECG.

【Context No.18】
The heart rate intraday time series data is returned in the format requested.
The endpoint mimics the Get Heart Rate Time Series endpoints. If your
application has the appropriate access, your calls to a time series endpoint
for a specific day (by using start and end dates on the same day or a period
of 24 hours), the response will include extended intraday values with
1-second, 1-minute, 5-minute or 15-minute detail level for that day. Unlike
other time series calls that allow fetching data of other users, intraday data
is available only for and to the authorized user.
The "1sec" detail-level may not always return data in 1 second sampling
outside of a recorded exercise. Sampling is more granular during exercise to
provide accuracy. To fetch the granular heart rate during an exercise, query
data using the [GET Activity TCX endpoint](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-tcx/).
### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

【Context No.20】
There are many factors that can affect a user’s breathing rate value.
Recording the data while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to
correctly and accurately collect breathing rate data. Data is only processed
when the user is still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too
short, this can prevent breathing rate data from being processed correctly. In
addition, if recorded data is incapable of computing specific sleep stages for
a period of sleep, this will compromise the user’s ability to retrieve a
breathing rate value.
The device automatically stops collecting breathing rate data after it
determines the user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the
user syncs their device, breathing rate data will begin processing for that
sleep period. It usually takes up to 15 minutes for the breathing rate data to
be processed and made available to download.
You can read more about **data accuracy** on
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00493-6>
### Subscription Support for Breathing Rate
Breathing Rate does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since
Breathing Rate is recorded during periods of sleep, the sleep notification
arrival time can be used to estimate when the Breathing Rate data will be
available (See the "Collecting Data" section). For applications that do not
track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep data, we recommend querying the
Breathing Rate data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The breathing rate endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
Breathing rate data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives
the user secure and transparent control over their data. The data is
thenprocessed and made available through the API after the user syncs their
device with the Fitbit data service.

### Collecting breathing rate data
Breathing rate data is collected when the user is in an extended period of
sleep of at least 3 hours.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s breathing rate value.
Recording the data while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to
correctly and accurately collect breathing rate data. Data is only processed
when the user is still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too
short, this can prevent breathing rate data from being processed correctly. In
addition, if recorded data is incapable of computing specific sleep stages for
a period of sleep, this will compromise the user’s ability to retrieve a
breathing rate value.
The device automatically stops collecting breathing rate data after it
determines the user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the
user syncs their device, breathing rate data will begin processing for that
sleep period. It usually takes up to 15 minutes for the breathing rate data to
be processed and made available to download.
You can read more about **data accuracy** on
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00493-6>
### Subscription Support for Breathing Rate
Breathing Rate does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since
Breathing Rate is recorded during periods of sleep, the sleep notification
arrival time can be used to estimate when the Breathing Rate data will be
available (See the "Collecting Data" section). For applications that do not
track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep data, we recommend querying the
Breathing Rate data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The breathing rate endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
Breathing rate data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives
the user secure and transparent control over their data. The data is
thenprocessed and made available through the API after the user syncs their
device with the Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support breathing rate data collection.

The cardio fitness score is calculated every time the person exercises. A
user’s cardio fitness score is determined by their resting heart rate, age,
gender, weight, and other personal information. The user’s cardio fitness
score will be shown as a range unless the user uses GPS for runs, in which
case it will be returned as a single numeric value. For more information, see

# Get Breathing Rate Summary by Date
This endpoint returns average breathing rate data for a single date. Breathing
Rate data applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep,” which is the longest
single period of time during which they were asleep on a given date.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
can and often does reflect a sleep period that began the day before. For
example, if you request a daily breathing rate for 2021-12-22, it may include
measurements that were taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user
started to sleep.
It uses [units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-

## Additional Information
### Localizing the consent page
The Fitbit consent page supports localization. Since it is just a web form,
the text is translated based on the user's "Language by Region/Country"
setting in their Fitbit account. The user's device or browser language
settings may translate the consent language, as well. We do not support a
query parameter that forces language conversion.

【Context No.42】
Since
Breathing Rate is recorded during periods of sleep,
the sleep notification arrival time can be used to estimate when the Breathing
Rate data will be available (See the "Collecting Data" section). For
applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep data, we
recommend querying the Breathing Rate data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The breathing rate endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
Breathing rate data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives
the user secure and transparent control over their data. The data is
thenprocessed and made available through the API after the user syncs their
device with the Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support breathing rate data collection. See
the [Fitbit Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to
determine if your specific device supports breathing rate.

api/breathing-rate/get-br-summary-by-date/)
[Get Breathing Rate Summary by Date](/build/reference/web-api/breathing-
rate/get-br-summary-by-date/)

【Context No.43】
The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

  * **calories** \- The top level time series for calories burned inclusive of BMR, tracked activity, and manually logged activities.
  * **caloriesBMR** \- Value includes only [BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) calories.
  * **activityCalories** \- The number of calories burned during the day for periods of time when the user was active above sedentary level. This value is calculated minute by minute for minutes that fall within this criteria. This includes activity burned calories and BMR.
  * **tracker/calories** \- Calories burned inclusive of BMR according to movement captured by a Fitbit tracker.
  * **tracker/activityCalories** \- Calculated similarly to _activityCalories_ , but uses only tracker data. Manually logged activities are excluded.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.

【Context No.53】
The heart rate intraday time series data is returned in the format requested.
The endpoint mimics the Get Heart Rate Time Series endpoints. If your
application has the appropriate access, your calls to a time series endpoint
for a specific day (by using start and end dates on the same day or a period
of 24 hours), the response will include extended intraday values with
1-second, 1-minute, 5-minute or 15-minute detail level for that day. Unlike
other time series calls that allow fetching data of other users, intraday data
is available only for and to the authorized user.
The "1sec" detail-level may not always return data in 1 second sampling
outside of a recorded exercise. Sampling is more granular during exercise to
provide accuracy. To fetch the granular heart rate during an exercise, query
data using the [GET Activity TCX endpoint](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-tcx/).
### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

## Output Indicator
Ensure that, except for the parts modified to follow the latest specifications, the structure and format of the code remain identical to the original code.
Here, "identical" means that there should be no differences (diff) whatsoever, including in indentation, spaces, line breaks, and code structure, which should all be exactly the same as the original.
If there are any changes beyond the modified sections, this is considered incorrect.
Also, verify that the modified code conforms to the latest specifications.
