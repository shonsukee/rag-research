【Context No.1】
Heart rate data recorded by the device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).

Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data.

AFib can have serious health effects. You should contact your doctor.
  * **Normal sinus rhythm (NSR)** : Your heart rhythm appears normal. It doesn’t show signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm.
  * **Inconclusive** : If your heart rate is over 120 bpm or under 50 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. There are many possible reasons for getting an inconclusive result, but common causes are moving too much during the assessment, not resting git stat your hands on a table, or other arrhythmia.
  * **Inconclusive: High heart rate** : If your heart rate is over 120 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. Heart rate can be high for many reasons, such as: recent exercise, stress, nervousness, alcohol, dehydration, infection, AFib, or other arrhythmia.
  * **Inconclusive: Low heart rate** : If your heart rate is under 50 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. Heart rate can be low for many reasons, such as: taking certain medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, having excellent aerobic fitness, or other arrhythmia.
### Subscription Support for ECG
ECG does not support subscription notifications (webhooks). We recommend
querying ECG data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight). However, the frequency or rate at which you query
ECG data should be based on your specific use cases and with this in mind.
### Rate limit
The ECG endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
ECG data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the data syncs with the Fitbit ECG
service.
Most of the current devices sold support ECG data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports ECG.

5. If BMR or EER have been used to estimate calories for the whole specific day (no tracker data), intraday data for calories would be flat and estimated according to the simple equation **calories_1m = BMR(EER)/24/60.**
#### Using BMR/EER Algorithms
If a user had no Fitbit tracker data for the specific day then the greater of
Logged Activities + BMR (for minutes when there is no activity) and the
calories calculated from the EER for that day (if EER enabled for this user's
profile) are taken. In case, there was some data from the tracker for the
specific day, that data where available is used and for time where data is
unavailable, the BMR is used. If the total is less than 20% greater than BMR
then the EER (cals < EER * 0.8) is used. EER never used to calculate calories
for today.
#### Using BMR Formula
Fitbit uses the standard MD Mifflin-St Jeor equation:
#### EER Formula (TEE total energy expenditure)
The EER Formula is based on
<http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2006/oct/pdf/06_0034.pdf>, which in turn is
based on "Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary reference intakes for energy,
carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids
(macronutrients). Washington (DC): National Academy Press; 2005."

Activity : Sport |
Activity : Id | The identifier or timestamp of the associated exercise.
Lap : StartTime | Timestamp representing each lap's start time.

Lap : DistanceMeters | Number of meters traveled during the exercise lap.

【Context No.14】
That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### "offset" query parameter
The offset query parameter is not fully supported and it's future is unknown.
Therefore, the only supported value is 0. To paginate, request the next and
previous links in the pagination response object. Using the "offset" query
parameter in any other capacity could cause your application to break.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

### "logType" values
The source of the activity log can be determined by the _logType_ response
element.
  * `auto_detected` activity logs are those created by Fitbit’s SmartTrack feature.
  * `manual` activity logs are user specified overrides of some or all tracker data.
  * `mobile_run` activity logs are created after completing a MobileRun.
  * `tracker` activity logs are those created using the multisport exercise mode on a Fitbit device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length).

【Context No.21】
In
addition, if recorded data is incapable of computing specific sleep stages for
a period of sleep, this will compromise the user’s ability to retrieve a
breathing rate value.
The device automatically stops collecting breathing rate data after it
determines the user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the
user syncs their device, breathing rate data will begin processing for that
sleep period. It usually takes up to 15 minutes for the breathing rate data to
be processed and made available to download.
You can read more about **data accuracy** on
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00493-6>
### Subscription Support for Breathing Rate
Breathing Rate does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since
Breathing Rate is recorded during periods of sleep, the sleep notification
arrival time can be used to estimate when the Breathing Rate data will be
available (See the "Collecting Data" section). For applications that do not
track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep data, we recommend querying the
Breathing Rate data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The breathing rate endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
Breathing rate data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives
the user secure and transparent control over their data. The data is
thenprocessed and made available through the API after the user syncs their
device with the Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support breathing rate data collection. See
the [Fitbit Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to
determine if your specific device supports breathing rate.

## Additional Information
You can read more about data accuracy in the **Clinical Study** section of the
[Fitbit ECG App Instructions for
Use](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14253977#samd).
Additional information about the Fitbit ECG app can be found in the help
article [What is the Fitbit ECG
app?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236718).
### Limit / Offset
ECG data is very large because of the waveforms. Because of this, we cannot
query and return large numbers of ECG results, and limit the number of results
to 10. The offset query parameter is not fully supported and it's future is
unknown. Therefore, the only supported value is 0. Using the "offset" query
parameter in any other capacity could cause your application to break.
To paginate, request the next and previous links in the pagination response
object. The next and previous link should include afterDate or beforeDate
parameters of the datetime for the last reading in each page.
### Collecting ECG data
Before taking your first reading, review the Heart Rhythm Assessment. The
Heart Rhythm Assessment is found in the Fitbit mobile application.
Instructions can be found in the section "How do I use the Fitbit ECG app?"
within the help article [What is the Fitbit ECG
app?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236718).
### Classification of ECG results
After the user takes a 30 second ECG reading or spot check, Fitbit classifies
the user's heart rhythm as one of the 5 results:
  * **Atrial fibrillation (AFib)** : Your heart rhythm shows signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm. AFib can have serious health effects. You should contact your doctor.
  * **Normal sinus rhythm (NSR)** : Your heart rhythm appears normal. It doesn’t show signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm.

【Context No.24】
The "1sec" detail-level may not always return data in 1 second sampling
outside of a recorded exercise. Sampling is more granular during exercise to
provide accuracy. To fetch the granular heart rate during an exercise, query
data using the [GET Activity TCX endpoint](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-tcx/).
### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.

# Get Breathing Rate Summary by Date
This endpoint returns average breathing rate data for a single date. Breathing
Rate data applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep,” which is the longest
single period of time during which they were asleep on a given date.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
can and often does reflect a sleep period that began the day before. For
example, if you request a daily breathing rate for 2021-12-22, it may include
measurements that were taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user
started to sleep.
It uses [units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-
design/#Unit-Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.

## Additional Information
### Displaying VO2 Max data
The cardio fitness score is calculated every time the person exercises. A
user’s cardio fitness score is determined by their resting heart rate, age,
gender, weight, and other personal information. The user’s cardio fitness
score will be shown as a range unless the user uses GPS for runs, in which
case it will be returned as a single numeric value. For more information, see
[What is My Cardio Score?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237924).
### Subscription Support for Cardio Fitness Score (VO2 Max)
VO2 Max does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks).

【Context No.35】
Data is only processed
when the user is still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too
short, this can prevent breathing rate data from being processed correctly. In
addition, if recorded data is incapable of computing specific sleep stages for
a period of sleep, this will compromise the user’s ability to retrieve a
breathing rate value.
The device automatically stops collecting breathing rate data after it
determines the user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the
user syncs their device, breathing rate data will begin processing for that
sleep period. It usually takes up to 15 minutes for the breathing rate data to
be processed and made available to download.
You can read more about **data accuracy** on
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00493-6>
### Subscription Support for Breathing Rate
Breathing Rate does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since
Breathing Rate is recorded during periods of sleep, the sleep notification
arrival time can be used to estimate when the Breathing Rate data will be
available (See the "Collecting Data" section). For applications that do not
track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep data, we recommend querying the
Breathing Rate data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The breathing rate endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
Breathing rate data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives
the user secure and transparent control over their data. The data is
thenprocessed and made available through the API after the user syncs their
device with the Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support breathing rate data collection. See
the [Fitbit Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to
determine if your specific device supports breathing rate.

## Additional Information
### Displaying VO2 Max data
The cardio fitness score is calculated every time the person exercises. A
user’s cardio fitness score is determined by their resting heart rate, age,
gender, weight, and other personal information. The user’s cardio fitness
score will be shown as a range unless the user uses GPS for runs, in which
case it will be returned as a single numeric value. For more information, see
[What is My Cardio Score?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237924).
### Subscription Support for Cardio Fitness Score (VO2 Max)
VO2 Max does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since VO2 Max is
recorded during exercise, the activity notification arrival time can be used
to estimate when the V02 max data will be available. For more information, see
[Displaying V02 Max data](/build/reference/web-api/cardio-fitness-score/get-
vo2max-summary-by-date/#Displaying-VO2-Max-data). For applications that do not
track activity, or cannot retrieve activity data, we recommend querying the
V02 max data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available (e.g.
12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The VO2 Max endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. For more
information, see [Rate Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/application-design/#Rate-Limits).
### Device compatibility
VO2 Max data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support VO2 Max data collection. For more
information, see the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports VO2 Max.

### Subscription Support for Temperature (Skin)
Temperature (Skin) does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since
Temperature (Skin) is recorded during periods of sleep, the sleep notification
arrival time can be used to estimate when the Temperature (Skin) data will be
available (See the "[Collecting Data](/build/reference/web-
api/temperature/get-temperature-skin-summary-by-date/#Collecting-Temperature-
Skin-data)" section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot
retrieve sleep data, we recommend querying the Temperature (Skin) data once or
twice a day to determine if new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
However, the frequency or rate at which you query Temperature (Skin) data
should be based on your specific use cases and with this in mind.
### Rate limit
The Temperature (Skin) endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See
[Rate Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-
design/#Rate-Limits).
### Device compatibility
Temperature (Skin) data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This
gives the user secure and transparent control over their data. The data is
then processed and made available through the API after the user syncs their
device with the Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support Temperature (Skin) data collection.
See the [Fitbit Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to
determine if your specific device supports Temperature (Skin).
#### Temperature Sensors
Some Fitbit devices use a dedicated temperature sensor to estimate the user’s
skin temperature variation each night. Other Fitbit devices use other sensors
to measure the temperature in the user’s surrounding area. See [How can Fitbit
help me track my
temperature?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237207) for more
information.

# Client Credentials Grant Flow
The /oauth2/token endpoint can do the following:
  * Exchange the authorization code for the initial access token and refresh token (See [OAuth2 Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/oauth2-token)).
This process is required when using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE].
  * Obtain a new access token and refresh token when the existing access token has expired (See [Refresh Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/refresh-token/)).
  * Initiate the Client Credentials authorization flow (See [Client Credentials](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/client-credentials/)).
Fitbit follows the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow as specified in [RFC
6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4). This
authorization flow is used with specific Fitbit API endpoints related to
business operations. It is not supported by the public Web APIs to retrieve
Fitbit user data.
The Client Credentials Grant flow has the following steps:
  1. The application sends a request to https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token with its client_id and client_secret; and
  2. Fitbit authenticates your application and issues an access token.
* * *

## Output Indicator
Ensure that, except for the parts modified to follow the latest specifications, the structure and format of the code remain identical to the original code. Here, "identical" means that there should be no differences (diff) whatsoever, including in indentation, spaces, line breaks, and code structure, which should all be exactly the same as the original.
If there are any changes beyond the modified sections, this is considered incorrect.
Also, verify that the modified code conforms to the latest specifications.
