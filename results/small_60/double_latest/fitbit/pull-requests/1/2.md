【Context No.1】
Heart rate data recorded by the device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).

5. If BMR or EER have been used to estimate calories for the whole specific day (no tracker data), intraday data for calories would be flat and estimated according to the simple equation **calories_1m = BMR(EER)/24/60.**
#### Using BMR/EER Algorithms
If a user had no Fitbit tracker data for the specific day then the greater of
Logged Activities + BMR (for minutes when there is no activity) and the
calories calculated from the EER for that day (if EER enabled for this user's
profile) are taken. In case, there was some data from the tracker for the
specific day, that data where available is used and for time where data is
unavailable, the BMR is used. If the total is less than 20% greater than BMR
then the EER (cals < EER * 0.8) is used. EER never used to calculate calories
for today.
#### Using BMR Formula
Fitbit uses the standard MD Mifflin-St Jeor equation:
#### EER Formula (TEE total energy expenditure)
The EER Formula is based on
<http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2006/oct/pdf/06_0034.pdf>, which in turn is
based on "Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary reference intakes for energy,
carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids

download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.
[!

【Context No.11】
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.

## Additional Information
You can read more about data accuracy in the **Clinical Study** section of the
[Fitbit ECG App Instructions for
Use](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14253977#samd).
Additional information about the Fitbit ECG app can be found in the help
article [What is the Fitbit ECG
app?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236718).
### Limit / Offset
ECG data is very large because of the waveforms. Because of this, we cannot
query and return large numbers of ECG results, and limit the number of results
to 10. The offset query parameter is not fully supported and it's future is
unknown. Therefore, the only supported value is 0. Using the "offset" query
parameter in any other capacity could cause your application to break.
To paginate, request the next and previous links in the pagination response
object. The next and previous link should include afterDate or beforeDate
parameters of the datetime for the last reading in each page.
### Collecting ECG data
Before taking your first reading, review the Heart Rhythm Assessment. The
Heart Rhythm Assessment is found in the Fitbit mobile application.
Instructions can be found in the section "How do I use the Fitbit ECG app?"
within the help article [What is the Fitbit ECG
app?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236718).
### Classification of ECG results
After the user takes a 30 second ECG reading or spot check, Fitbit classifies
the user's heart rhythm as one of the 5 results:
  * **Atrial fibrillation (AFib)** : Your heart rhythm shows signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm. AFib can have serious health effects. You should contact your doctor.
  * **Normal sinus rhythm (NSR)** : Your heart rhythm appears normal. It doesn’t show signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm.

## Additional Information
The activity log entries for a given day are displayed in the format requested
using units in the unit system corresponding to the Accept-Language header
provided.
#### Considerations
  * User data is only available since the user's join date or the first log entry date for the requested collection.
  * The tracker/... resource represents the daily activity values logged by the tracker device only, excluding manual activity log entires.
  * The tracker/calories resource does not include the Estimated Energy Requirement for calories estimation (EER) calculations for any dates even if they are turned on for the user's profile and use BMR level instead.
  * Elevation time series (/elevation, /floors) are only available for users with compatible trackers.
  * The activities collection are maintained for backwards compatible resource URLs (e.g. (activities/log/calories)).

**Calorie Time Series Differences**
  * **calories** \- The top level time series for calories burned inclusive of BMR, tracked activity, and manually logged activities.
  * **caloriesBMR** \- Value includes only [BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) calories.
  * **activityCalories** \- The number of calories burned during the day for periods of time when the user was active above sedentary level. This value is calculated minute by minute for minutes that fall within this criteria. This includes activity burned calories and BMR.

【Context No.16】
3. If a specific time interval was passed to the call via **start-time/end-time** parameters, **data-value** will include a summary only for the requested time period (versus whole day).
  4. For the **activities/log/calories** resource, each data point also includes the **level** field that reflects calculated activity level for that time period **( 0 - sedentary; 1 - lightly active; 2 - fairly active; 3 - very active)**.
  5. If BMR or EER have been used to estimate calories for the whole specific day (no tracker data), intraday data for calories would be flat and estimated according to the simple equation **calories_1m = BMR(EER)/24/60.**
#### Using BMR/EER Algorithms
If a user had no Fitbit tracker data for the specific day then the greater of
Logged Activities + BMR (for minutes when there is no activity) and the
calories calculated from the EER for that day (if EER enabled for this user's
profile) are taken. In case, there was some data from the tracker for the
specific day, that data where available is used and for time where data is
unavailable, the BMR is used. If the total is less than 20% greater than BMR
then the EER (cals < EER * 0.8) is used. EER never used to calculate calories
for today.
#### Using BMR Formula
Fitbit uses the standard MD Mifflin-St Jeor equation:
#### EER Formula (TEE total energy expenditure)
The EER Formula is based on
<http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2006/oct/pdf/06_0034.pdf>, which in turn is
based on "Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary reference intakes for energy,
carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids
(macronutrients). Washington (DC): National Academy Press; 2005."

### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible

## Additional Information

### "logType" values
The source of the activity log can be determined by the _logType_ response
element.
  * `auto_detected` activity logs are those created by Fitbit’s SmartTrack feature.
  * `manual` activity logs are user specified overrides of some or all tracker data.
  * `mobile_run` activity logs are created after completing a MobileRun.
  * `tracker` activity logs are those created using the multisport exercise mode on a Fitbit device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length).

### Localizing the consent page
The Fitbit consent page supports localization. Since it is just a web form,
the text is translated based on the user's "Language by Region/Country"
setting in their Fitbit account. The user's device or browser language
settings may translate the consent language, as well. We do not support a
query parameter that forces language conversion.

【Context No.33】
This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.

### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

【Context No.37】
The activity intraday time series data for a given resource is returned in the
format requested. The endpoint mimics the Get Activity Time Series endpoints.
If your application has the appropriate access, your calls to a time series
endpoint for a specific day (by using start and end dates on the same day or a
period of 24 hours), the response will include extended intraday values with
1-minute, 5-minute or 15-minute detail level for that day. Unlike other time
series calls that allow fetching data of other users, intraday data is
available only for and to the authorized user.
Any discrepancies between time series detail-level totals vs daily summary
totals is likely due to how the device calculates on-wrist and off-wrist data.
On-wrist data is defined as data collected while the device is worn. On-wrist
data is also referred to as Intraday data. Off-wrist data is defined as data
collected while the device is not worn. For example, step data can be
collected if the device was in a bag while driving down a bumpy road. By
design, daily summary totals include on-wrist totals and off-wrist totals;
while Intraday totals include on-wrist totals only.
#### Considerations
  1. If a user hasn't synced a tracker for more than seven (7) days, the tracker stores only summary values for the days older than one week. In this case, the intraday data for steps is zero and the intraday calories are calculated from BMR or EER. Intraday steps could be estimated from the total daily summary data by the equation above.
  2. For the current day we will include only values until current timestamp (in the user's timezone).
  3. If a specific time interval was passed to the call via **start-time/end-time** parameters, **data-value** will include a summary only for the requested time period (versus whole day).
  4. For the **activities/log/calories** resource, each data point also includes the **level** field that reflects calculated activity level for that time period **( 0 - sedentary; 1 - lightly active; 2 - fairly active; 3 - very active)**.
  5.

### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

design, daily summary totals include on-wrist totals and off-wrist totals;
while Intraday totals include on-wrist totals only.
#### Considerations
  1. If a user hasn't synced a tracker for more than seven (7) days, the tracker stores only summary values for the days older than one week. In this case, the intraday data for steps is zero and the intraday calories are calculated from BMR or EER. Intraday steps could be estimated from the total daily summary data by the equation above.
  2. For the current day we will include only values until current timestamp (in the user's timezone).
  3. If a specific time interval was passed to the call via **start-time/end-time** parameters, **data-value** will include a summary only for the requested time period (versus whole day).

## Additional Information
### Subscription Support for Temperature (Core)
Temperature (Core) does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). This data
is manually entered by the user, so we don’t believe it will change
frequently. We recommend querying Temperature (Core) data once or twice a day
to determine if new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight). However,
the frequency or rate at which you query Temperature (Core) data should be
based on your specific use cases and with this in mind.
### Rate limit
The Temperature (core) endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See
[Rate Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-
design/#Rate-Limits).
### Device compatibility
Temperature (Core) data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This
gives the user secure and transparent control over their data.

# Client Credentials Grant Flow
The /oauth2/token endpoint can do the following:
  * Exchange the authorization code for the initial access token and refresh token (See [OAuth2 Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/oauth2-token)).
This process is required when using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE].
  * Obtain a new access token and refresh token when the existing access token has expired (See [Refresh Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/refresh-token/)).
  * Initiate the Client Credentials authorization flow (See [Client Credentials](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/client-credentials/)).
Fitbit follows the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow as specified in [RFC
6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4). This
authorization flow is used with specific Fitbit API endpoints related to
business operations. It is not supported by the public Web APIs to retrieve
Fitbit user data.
The Client Credentials Grant flow has the following steps:
  1. The application sends a request to https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token with its client_id and client_secret; and
  2. Fitbit authenticates your application and issues an access token.
* * *
## Request

`31536000` for 1 year **Default:** 28800 **Type:** string
**Request Headers** authorization | required | Must be set to Basic followed by a space, then the Base64 encoded string of your application's client id and secret concatenated with a colon. For example, the Base64 encoded string, **Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudCBzZWNyZXQ=** , is decoded as **"client_id:client secret"**. **Token type:** `Basic`

## Additional Information
At startup, we recommend your application retrieve the complete list of
activities, cache the results and display the results in the application’s UI
later.

【Context No.59】
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

## Output Indicator
Ensure that, except for the parts modified to follow the latest specifications, the structure and format of the code remain identical to the original code. Here, "identical" means that there should be no differences (diff) whatsoever, including in indentation, spaces, line breaks, and code structure, which should all be exactly the same as the original.
If there are any changes beyond the modified sections, this is considered incorrect.
Also, verify that the modified code conforms to the latest specifications.
