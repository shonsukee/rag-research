【Context No.2】
## Sleep Time Series (Deprecated)
**Note:** This API has been deprecated with the introduction of version 1.2 of
the Sleep APIs described above. Sleep Stages data cannot be retrieved with
this API. If your application requires data consistency while you transition
over to the version 1.2 Sleep APIs, you can get this data through the [version
1 Get Sleep Logs by Date endpoint](/build/reference/web-api/sleep-v1/#get-
sleep-logs-by-date).
The **Get Sleep Time Series** endpoint returns time series data in the
specified range for a given resource in the format requested using units in
the [unit system](/build/reference/web-api/basics#units) that corresponds to
the Accept-Language header provided.
**Note:** Even if you provide earlier dates in the request, the response
retrieves only data since the user's join date or the first log entry date for
the requested collection.
#### Resource URL
There are two acceptable formats for retrieving intraday data:

    GET https://api.fitbit.com/1/user/[user-id]/[resource-path]/date/[date]/[period].json

**api-version** | The API version. Currently version **1**.
---|---
**user-id** | The encoded ID of the user. Use "-" (dash) for current logged-in user.
**resource-path** | The resource path; see the **Resource Path Options** below for a list of options.
**date** | The end date of the period specified in the format **yyyy-MM-dd** or **today**.
**period** | The range for which data will be returned. Options are **1d, 7d, 30d, 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y,** or **max.**

    GET https://api.fitbit.com/1/user/[user-id]/[resource-path]/date/[base-date]/[end-date].json

**api-version** | The API version. Currently version **1**.
---|---

### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.

Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data.

【Context No.5】
Any application will get added security with the ability to mitigate
authorization code interception attacks. This section will demonstrate in five
steps how an application obtains the user’s authorization using PKCE.
#### Step 1 - Generate the Code Verifier and Code Challenge
The application needs to generate two values to keep the OAuth 2.0 protocol
and the Fitbit user data secure:
  * A cryptographically random value between 43-128 characters long called a _code verifier_
  * A [SHA-256](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6234) hash of the code verifier, [ base64url encoded](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648) with padding omitted, called the _code challenge_
Transforming the code verifier into the code challenge requires the use of
libraries that implement the SHA-256 hash and Base64Url encoding
specifications. The optional Base64Url [padding
characters](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-3.2) (`=`)
should be omitted. For example, if the code verifier is
`01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789`, the pseudocode
`base64UrlEncode(sha256Hash(code_verifier))` should produce a code challenge
of `-4cf-Mzo_qg9-uq0F4QwWhRh4AjcAqNx7SbYVsdmyQM`.
#### Step 2 - Request Authorization to Fitbit User Data
Using a web browser, the application calls the Authorize endpoint to display
Fitbit's Authorization page to the user. If necessary, the user may need to
log in with their Fitbit credentials.
> **Mobile Development** : Use either [ custom
> tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/overview/)
> (Android) or the [
> SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller)
> (iOS) instead of their webview counterparts. This allows the Fitbit user to
> know they are logging into the secure Fitbit site.
The required query parameters are:
  * `client_id`: The Fitbit API application ID from <https://dev.fitbit.com/apps> .
  * `scope`: A space-delimited list of data collections requested by the application.

## Additional Information
The response if provided in the format requested using units in the unit
system which corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
A recent activity record contains the distance and duration values recorded
during the last time the activity was logged. The record retrieved can be used
to log the activity via the Log Activity endpoint with the same or adjusted
values for distance and duration.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`

_optional / required_ | The code challenge is derived from the code verifier by using a transformation on the code verifier. The code verifier is a cryptographically random string dynamically created for each authorization request. The available transformations are `S256 ` and `plain`. `S256`: must be used if supported by the client:
_code_challenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))_.
`plain`: does not mitigate as wide a range of attacks as `S256` and may be
used only if the client cannot technically support `S256`: _code_challenge =

If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.

activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more

### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

【Context No.11】
* Elevation time series (/elevation, /floors) are only available for users with compatible trackers.
  * The activities collection are maintained for backwards compatible resource URLs (e.g. (activities/log/calories)).

**Calorie Time Series Differences**
  * **calories** \- The top level time series for calories burned inclusive of BMR, tracked activity, and manually logged activities.
  * **caloriesBMR** \- Value includes only [BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) calories.
  * **activityCalories** \- The number of calories burned during the day for periods of time when the user was active above sedentary level. This value is calculated minute by minute for minutes that fall within this criteria. This includes activity burned calories and BMR.
  * **tracker/calories** \- Calories burned inclusive of BMR according to movement captured by a Fitbit tracker.
  * **tracker/activityCalories** \- Calculated similarly to _activityCalories_ , but uses only tracker data. Manually logged activities are excluded.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.

# Client Credentials Grant Flow
The /oauth2/token endpoint can do the following:
  * Exchange the authorization code for the initial access token and refresh token (See [OAuth2 Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/oauth2-token)).
This process is required when using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE].
  * Obtain a new access token and refresh token when the existing access token has expired (See [Refresh Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/refresh-token/)).
  * Initiate the Client Credentials authorization flow (See [Client Credentials](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/client-credentials/)).
Fitbit follows the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow as specified in [RFC
6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4). This
authorization flow is used with specific Fitbit API endpoints related to
business operations. It is not supported by the public Web APIs to retrieve
Fitbit user data.
The Client Credentials Grant flow has the following steps:
  1. The application sends a request to https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token with its client_id and client_secret; and
  2. Fitbit authenticates your application and issues an access token.

If the total is less than 20% greater than BMR
then the EER (cals < EER * 0.8) is used. EER never used to calculate calories
for today.
#### Using BMR Formula
Fitbit uses the standard MD Mifflin-St Jeor equation:

    9.99 * weightKg + 6.25*heightCm - 4.92*ageYears + s, where s is +5 for
    males and -161 for female
#### EER Formula (TEE total energy expenditure)
The EER Formula is based on
<http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2006/oct/pdf/06_0034.pdf>, which in turn is
based on "Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary reference intakes for energy,
carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids
(macronutrients). Washington (DC): National Academy Press; 2005."

#### MALE-based EER Formula:

    TEE = 864 - 9.72 x age (years) + 1.0 x (14.2 x weight(kg) + 503 x height
    (meters))
#### FEMALE-based EER Formula:

  * 30 active minutes; and
  * Calories out is user specific, which accounts for BMR.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.

## Additional Information
Access to the Intraday Time Series for personal use (accessing your own data)
is available through the "Personal" App Type.
**Restriction** : Activity Intraday data cannot be retrieved for more than a
24 hour period. Any requests that expand over a 24 hour period will result
with the summary data for the date range specified.
The activity intraday time series data for a given resource is returned in the
format requested. The endpoint mimics the Get Activity Time Series endpoints.
If your application has the appropriate access, your calls to a time series
endpoint for a specific day (by using start and end dates on the same day or a
period of 24 hours), the response will include extended intraday values with
1-minute, 5-minute or 15-minute detail level for that day. Unlike other time
series calls that allow fetching data of other users, intraday data is
available only for and to the authorized user.
Any discrepancies between time series detail-level totals vs daily summary
totals is likely due to how the device calculates on-wrist and off-wrist data.
On-wrist data is defined as data collected while the device is worn. On-wrist
data is also referred to as Intraday data. Off-wrist data is defined as data
collected while the device is not worn. For example, step data can be
collected if the device was in a bag while driving down a bumpy road. By
design, daily summary totals include on-wrist totals and off-wrist totals;
while Intraday totals include on-wrist totals only.
#### Considerations
  1. If a user hasn't synced a tracker for more than seven (7) days, the tracker stores only summary values for the days older than one week. In this case, the intraday data for steps is zero and the intraday calories are calculated from BMR or EER. Intraday steps could be estimated from the total daily summary data by the equation above.

### Activity webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.

### Limit / Offset
ECG data is very large because of the waveforms. Because of this, we cannot
query and return large numbers of ECG results, and limit the number of results
to 10. The offset query parameter is not fully supported and it's future is
unknown. Therefore, the only supported value is 0. Using the "offset" query
parameter in any other capacity could cause your application to break.

`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart

that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise

the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user

last seven (7) days worth of data (the previous six days plus today's date) in
real time.
The **Average Daily Step Count** privacy setting in the Fitbit user's profile
settings allows a user to be included to Friends leaderboard whether they hide
themselves on their profile settings or not.
### Inviting friends
Fitbit does not offer endpoints that can send or respond to friend invitation
requests. The Fitbit user must send friend requests through the mobile
application or Fitbit.com. See [How do I connect with friends on
Fitbit?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237026)

【Context No.38】
401 | The request requires user authentication.
> **Note:** For a complete list of response codes, please refer to the
> [Troubleshooting Guide](/build/reference/web-api/troubleshooting-
> guide/error-messages/).

## Additional Information
The activity log entries for a given day are displayed in the format requested
using units in the unit system corresponding to the Accept-Language header
provided.
#### Privacy Setting
The Fitbit privacy setting Activities (“Friends Only” and “Public”) grants
access to a user's resource with the exception that the response DOES NOT
include a detailed list of activity log entries.
#### Considerations
  1. Daily summary data and daily goals for elevation (elevation, floors) only included for users with a device with an altimeter.
  2. The steps field in activity log entries included only for activities that have steps (e.g. "Walking", "Running"); distance only included when it is relevant.
  3. Calorie burn goal (caloriesOut) represents either dynamic daily target from the premium trainer plan or manual calorie burn goal. Goals are included in the response only for today and 21 days in the past.
### Retrieving heart rate data within the activity response
The Heart Rate Zones data array can be displayed within this endpoint's
response. For this to occur, the following are required. If any of the items
are missing, the data array will not be displayed.
  1. The _heartrate_ scope enabled by the user.
  2. A heart rate enabled device paired to the user's account.
  3. Heart rate data recorded by the device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.

【Context No.39】
We do not support a
query parameter that forces language conversion.

【Context No.43】
The heart rate intraday time series data is returned in the format requested.
The endpoint mimics the Get Heart Rate Time Series endpoints. If your
application has the appropriate access, your calls to a time series endpoint
for a specific day (by using start and end dates on the same day or a period
of 24 hours), the response will include extended intraday values with
1-second, 1-minute, 5-minute or 15-minute detail level for that day. Unlike
other time series calls that allow fetching data of other users, intraday data
is available only for and to the authorized user.
The "1sec" detail-level may not always return data in 1 second sampling
outside of a recorded exercise. Sampling is more granular during exercise to
provide accuracy. To fetch the granular heart rate during an exercise, query
data using the [GET Activity TCX endpoint](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-tcx/).
### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

## Additional Information
The data is returned in the format requested using units in the unit system
which corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
Activity statistics includes Lifetime and Best achievement values from the My
Achievements tile on the website dashboard. Response contains both statistics
from the tracker device and total numbers including tracker data and manual
activity log entries as seen on the Fitbit website dashboard.
The Fitbit user's `My Achievements (Friends or Anyone)` privacy permission
grants access to user's resource.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data.

is manually entered by the user, so we don’t believe it will change
frequently. We recommend querying Temperature (Core) data once or twice a day
to determine if new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).

【Context No.52】
### Subscription Support for ECG
ECG does not support subscription notifications (webhooks). We recommend
querying ECG data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight). However, the frequency or rate at which you query
ECG data should be based on your specific use cases and with this in mind.
### Rate limit
The ECG endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
ECG data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the data syncs with the Fitbit ECG
service.
Most of the current devices sold support ECG data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports ECG.

## Additional Information
Access to the Intraday Time Series for personal use (accessing your own data)
is available through the "Personal" App Type.
**Restriction** : Activity Intraday data cannot be retrieved for more than a
24 hour period. Any requests that expand over a 24 hour period will result
with the summary data for the date range specified.
The activity intraday time series data for a given resource is returned in the
format requested. The endpoint mimics the Get Activity Time Series endpoints.
If your application has the appropriate access, your calls to a time series
endpoint for a specific day (by using start and end dates on the same day or a
period of 24 hours), the response will include extended intraday values with
1-minute, 5-minute or 15-minute detail level for that day. Unlike other time
series calls that allow fetching data of other users, intraday data is
available only for and to the authorized user.
Any discrepancies between time series detail-level totals vs daily summary
totals is likely due to how the device calculates on-wrist and off-wrist data.
On-wrist data is defined as data collected while the device is worn. On-wrist
data is also referred to as Intraday data. Off-wrist data is defined as data
collected while the device is not worn. For example, step data can be
collected if the device was in a bag while driving down a bumpy road. By
design, daily summary totals include on-wrist totals and off-wrist totals;
while Intraday totals include on-wrist totals only.
#### Considerations
  1. If a user hasn't synced a tracker for more than seven (7) days, the tracker stores only summary values for the days older than one week.

# Authorization
Fitbit requires applications use the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) to securely authorize access
to Fitbit user data. Fitbit recommends using the best OAuth 2.0 or HTTP client
library available for your preferred application platform and programming
language. Many times, these libraries contain sample code to help you get
started. Fitbit’s Web API uses a common implementation of the OAuth 2.0
specification, so a Fitbit-specific library is not required. For a list of
OAuth 2.0 libraries suggested by our developer community, see [ Libraries and
Sample Code](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/libraries-and-sample-
code/)
For a complete interactive walkthrough of the authorization flow see the
[OAuth 2.0 Tutorial](/build/reference/web-api/troubleshooting-
guide/oauth2-tutorial/).
There are three main steps to OAuth 2.0:
  1. Request authorization from a user to access their data.
  2. Query the user's data using the provided _access token_.
  3. Refresh expired access tokens with the corresponding _refresh token_.
## Authorization Code Grant Flow with PKCE
There are several authorization flows specific to the OAuth 2.0 protocol. For
best security, Fitbit recommends using the Authorization Code Grant Flow with
Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) defined by [RFC
7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636). PKCE supplements the Authorization
Code Grant flow with a dynamically created cryptographically random key (“code
verifier”) and its transform value (“code challenge”) to verify the client.
Any application will get added security with the ability to mitigate
authorization code interception attacks. This section will demonstrate in five
steps how an application obtains the user’s authorization using PKCE.

## Output Indicator
Ensure that, except for the parts modified to follow the latest specifications, the structure and format of the code remain identical to the original code. Here, "identical" means that there should be no differences (diff) whatsoever, including in indentation, spaces, line breaks, and code structure, which should all be exactly the same as the original.
If there are any changes beyond the modified sections, this is considered incorrect.
Also, verify that the modified code conforms to the latest specifications.
