## Sleep Time Series (Deprecated)
**Note:** This API has been deprecated with the introduction of version 1.2 of
the Sleep APIs described above. Sleep Stages data cannot be retrieved with
this API. If your application requires data consistency while you transition
over to the version 1.2 Sleep APIs, you can get this data through the [version
1 Get Sleep Logs by Date endpoint](/build/reference/web-api/sleep-v1/#get-
sleep-logs-by-date).
The **Get Sleep Time Series** endpoint returns time series data in the
specified range for a given resource in the format requested using units in
the [unit system](/build/reference/web-api/basics#units) that corresponds to
the Accept-Language header provided.
**Note:** Even if you provide earlier dates in the request, the response
retrieves only data since the user's join date or the first log entry date for
the requested collection.

# Sleep Logs Version 1 (Deprecated)
## Overview
These endpoints are deprecated and support for them may end unexpectedly. If
your application does not depend on the sleep as calculated by these
endpoints, please use the new [v1.2 sleep endpoints](/build/reference/web-

## Get Sleep Logs by Date
The **Get Sleep Logs by Date** endpoint returns a summary and list of a user's
sleep log entries (including naps) as well as detailed sleep entry data for a
given day.
The relationship between sleep log entry properties is expressed with the
following equation:

     timeInBed = minutesToFallAsleep + minutesAsleep + minutesAwake +
     minutesAfterWakeup

【Context No.1】
## Additional Information
The response if provided in the format requested using units in the unit
system which corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
A recent activity record contains the distance and duration values recorded
during the last time the activity was logged. The record retrieved can be used
to log the activity via the Log Activity endpoint with the same or adjusted
values for distance and duration.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.

activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more

### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.

【Context No.8】
distance | Distance traveled associated with the recorded activity.
duration | The length in time (milliseconds) after the exercise was edited. This value will contain pauses during the exercise.
name | The name of the recorded activity.

## Additional Information
The response if provided in the format requested using units in the unit
system which corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.

【Context No.9】
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.

## Additional Information
The response uses the measurement units as defined in the unit system, which
corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
#### Considerations
  * Only the current goals are returned.
  * Floors goal only returned for users who currently or have previously paired a Fitbit device with an altimeter.
  * Calories out goal represents either dynamic daily target from the Premium trainer plan or manual calorie burn goal.
The default daily goal values are:
  * 10 floors;
  * 30 active minutes; and
  * Calories out is user specific, which accounts for BMR.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and

action must be taken.

gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.

**Calorie Time Series Differences**
  * **calories** \- The top level time series for calories burned inclusive of BMR, tracked activity, and manually logged activities.
  * **caloriesBMR** \- Value includes only [BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) calories.
  * **activityCalories** \- The number of calories burned during the day for periods of time when the user was active above sedentary level. This value is calculated minute by minute for minutes that fall within this criteria. This includes activity burned calories and BMR.
  * **tracker/calories** \- Calories burned inclusive of BMR according to movement captured by a Fitbit tracker.
  * **tracker/activityCalories** \- Calculated similarly to _activityCalories_ , but uses only tracker data. Manually logged activities are excluded.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length.

## Additional Information
You can read more about data accuracy in the **Clinical Study** section of the
[Fitbit ECG App Instructions for
Use](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14253977#samd).
Additional information about the Fitbit ECG app can be found in the help
article [What is the Fitbit ECG
app?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236718).
### Limit / Offset
ECG data is very large because of the waveforms. Because of this, we cannot
query and return large numbers of ECG results, and limit the number of results
to 10. The offset query parameter is not fully supported and it's future is
unknown. Therefore, the only supported value is 0. Using the "offset" query
parameter in any other capacity could cause your application to break.

## Additional Information
The data is returned in the format requested using units in the unit system
which corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
Activity statistics includes Lifetime and Best achievement values from the My
Achievements tile on the website dashboard. Response contains both statistics
from the tracker device and total numbers including tracker data and manual
activity log entries as seen on the Fitbit website dashboard.
The Fitbit user's `My Achievements (Friends or Anyone)` privacy permission
grants access to user's resource.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data.

## Additional Information
Access to the Intraday Time Series for personal use (accessing your own data)
is available through the "Personal" App Type.
**Restriction** : Activity Intraday data cannot be retrieved for more than a
24 hour period. Any requests that expand over a 24 hour period will result
with the summary data for the date range specified.
The activity intraday time series data for a given resource is returned in the
format requested. The endpoint mimics the Get Activity Time Series endpoints.
If your application has the appropriate access, your calls to a time series
endpoint for a specific day (by using start and end dates on the same day or a
period of 24 hours), the response will include extended intraday values with
1-minute, 5-minute or 15-minute detail level for that day. Unlike other time
series calls that allow fetching data of other users, intraday data is
available only for and to the authorized user.
Any discrepancies between time series detail-level totals vs daily summary
totals is likely due to how the device calculates on-wrist and off-wrist data.
On-wrist data is defined as data collected while the device is worn. On-wrist
data is also referred to as Intraday data. Off-wrist data is defined as data
collected while the device is not worn. For example, step data can be
collected if the device was in a bag while driving down a bumpy road. By
design, daily summary totals include on-wrist totals and off-wrist totals;
while Intraday totals include on-wrist totals only.
#### Considerations
  1. If a user hasn't synced a tracker for more than seven (7) days, the tracker stores only summary values for the days older than one week. In this case, the intraday data for steps is zero and the intraday calories are calculated from BMR or EER. Intraday steps could be estimated from the total daily summary data by the equation above.

## Additional Information
The activity log entries for a given day are displayed in the format requested
using units in the unit system corresponding to the Accept-Language header
provided.
#### Privacy Setting
The Fitbit privacy setting Activities (“Friends Only” and “Public”) grants
access to a user's resource with the exception that the response DOES NOT
include a detailed list of activity log entries.
#### Considerations
  1. Daily summary data and daily goals for elevation (elevation, floors) only included for users with a device with an altimeter.
  2. The steps field in activity log entries included only for activities that have steps (e.g. "Walking", "Running"); distance only included when it is relevant.
  3. Calorie burn goal (caloriesOut) represents either dynamic daily target from the premium trainer plan or manual calorie burn goal. Goals are included in the response only for today and 21 days in the past.
### Retrieving heart rate data within the activity response
The Heart Rate Zones data array can be displayed within this endpoint's
response. For this to occur, the following are required. If any of the items
are missing, the data array will not be displayed.
  1. The _heartrate_ scope enabled by the user.
  2. A heart rate enabled device paired to the user's account.
  3. Heart rate data recorded by the device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.

【Context No.38】
If the total is less than 20% greater than BMR
then the EER (cals < EER * 0.8) is used. EER never used to calculate calories
for today.
#### Using BMR Formula
Fitbit uses the standard MD Mifflin-St Jeor equation:

    9.99 * weightKg + 6.25*heightCm - 4.92*ageYears + s, where s is +5 for
    males and -161 for female
#### EER Formula (TEE total energy expenditure)
The EER Formula is based on
<http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2006/oct/pdf/06_0034.pdf>, which in turn is
based on "Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary reference intakes for energy,
carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids
(macronutrients). Washington (DC): National Academy Press; 2005."
[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309085373&page=204](http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309085373&page=204)
#### MALE-based EER Formula:

    TEE = 864 - 9.72 x age (years) + 1.0 x (14.2 x weight(kg) + 503 x height
    (meters))
#### FEMALE-based EER Formula:

    TEE = 387 - 7.31 x age (years) + 1.0 x (10.9 x weight(kg) + 660.7 x height
    (meters))
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise

【Context No.42】
The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

【Context No.44】
Any application will get added security with the ability to mitigate
authorization code interception attacks. This section will demonstrate in five
steps how an application obtains the user’s authorization using PKCE.
#### Step 1 - Generate the Code Verifier and Code Challenge
The application needs to generate two values to keep the OAuth 2.0 protocol
and the Fitbit user data secure:
  * A cryptographically random value between 43-128 characters long called a _code verifier_
  * A [SHA-256](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6234) hash of the code verifier, [ base64url encoded](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648) with padding omitted, called the _code challenge_
Transforming the code verifier into the code challenge requires the use of
libraries that implement the SHA-256 hash and Base64Url encoding
specifications. The optional Base64Url [padding
characters](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-3.2) (`=`)
should be omitted. For example, if the code verifier is
`01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789`, the pseudocode
`base64UrlEncode(sha256Hash(code_verifier))` should produce a code challenge
of `-4cf-Mzo_qg9-uq0F4QwWhRh4AjcAqNx7SbYVsdmyQM`.
#### Step 2 - Request Authorization to Fitbit User Data
Using a web browser, the application calls the Authorize endpoint to display
Fitbit's Authorization page to the user. If necessary, the user may need to
log in with their Fitbit credentials.
> **Mobile Development** : Use either [ custom
> tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/overview/)
> (Android) or the [
> SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller)
> (iOS) instead of their webview counterparts. This allows the Fitbit user to
> know they are logging into the secure Fitbit site.
The required query parameters are:
  * `client_id`: The Fitbit API application ID from <https://dev.fitbit.com/apps> .
  * `scope`: A space-delimited list of data collections requested by the application.

### Collecting ECG data
Before taking your first reading, review the Heart Rhythm Assessment. The
Heart Rhythm Assessment is found in the Fitbit mobile application.
Instructions can be found in the section "How do I use the Fitbit ECG app?"
within the help article [What is the Fitbit ECG
app?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236718).
### Classification of ECG results
After the user takes a 30 second ECG reading or spot check, Fitbit classifies
the user's heart rhythm as one of the 5 results:
  * **Atrial fibrillation (AFib)** : Your heart rhythm shows signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm. AFib can have serious health effects. You should contact your doctor.
  * **Normal sinus rhythm (NSR)** : Your heart rhythm appears normal. It doesn’t show signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm.
  * **Inconclusive** : If your heart rate is over 120 bpm or under 50 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. There are many possible reasons for getting an inconclusive result, but common causes are moving too much during the assessment, not resting git stat your hands on a table, or other arrhythmia.
  * **Inconclusive: High heart rate** : If your heart rate is over 120 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. Heart rate can be high for many reasons, such as: recent exercise, stress, nervousness, alcohol, dehydration, infection, AFib, or other arrhythmia.
  * **Inconclusive: Low heart rate** : If your heart rate is under 50 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. Heart rate can be low for many reasons, such as: taking certain medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, having excellent aerobic fitness, or other arrhythmia.

# Client Credentials Grant Flow
The /oauth2/token endpoint can do the following:
  * Exchange the authorization code for the initial access token and refresh token (See [OAuth2 Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/oauth2-token)).
This process is required when using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE].
  * Obtain a new access token and refresh token when the existing access token has expired (See [Refresh Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/refresh-token/)).
  * Initiate the Client Credentials authorization flow (See [Client Credentials](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/client-credentials/)).
Fitbit follows the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow as specified in [RFC
6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4). This
authorization flow is used with specific Fitbit API endpoints related to
business operations. It is not supported by the public Web APIs to retrieve
Fitbit user data.
The Client Credentials Grant flow has the following steps:
  1. The application sends a request to https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token with its client_id and client_secret; and
  2. Fitbit authenticates your application and issues an access token.

## Additional Information
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

## Output Indicator
Ensure that, except for the parts modified to follow the latest specifications, the structure and format of the code remain identical to the original code. Here, "identical" means that there should be no differences (diff) whatsoever, including in indentation, spaces, line breaks, and code structure, which should all be exactly the same as the original.
If there are any changes beyond the modified sections, this is considered incorrect.
Also, verify that the modified code conforms to the latest specifications.
