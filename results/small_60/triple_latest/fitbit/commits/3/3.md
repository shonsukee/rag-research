## Sleep Time Series (Deprecated)
**Note:** This API has been deprecated with the introduction of version 1.2 of
the Sleep APIs described above. Sleep Stages data cannot be retrieved with
this API. If your application requires data consistency while you transition
over to the version 1.2 Sleep APIs, you can get this data through the [version
1 Get Sleep Logs by Date endpoint](/build/reference/web-api/sleep-v1/#get-
sleep-logs-by-date).
The **Get Sleep Time Series** endpoint returns time series data in the
specified range for a given resource in the format requested using units in
the [unit system](/build/reference/web-api/basics#units) that corresponds to
the Accept-Language header provided.
**Note:** Even if you provide earlier dates in the request, the response
retrieves only data since the user's join date or the first log entry date for
the requested collection.

【Context No.1】
Heart rate data recorded by the device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).

length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.

activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more

[Get Lifetime Stats](/build/reference/web-api/activity/get-lifetime-stats/)

【Context No.11】
5. If BMR or EER have been used to estimate calories for the whole specific day (no tracker data), intraday data for calories would be flat and estimated according to the simple equation **calories_1m = BMR(EER)/24/60.**
#### Using BMR/EER Algorithms
If a user had no Fitbit tracker data for the specific day then the greater of
Logged Activities + BMR (for minutes when there is no activity) and the
calories calculated from the EER for that day (if EER enabled for this user's
profile) are taken. In case, there was some data from the tracker for the
specific day, that data where available is used and for time where data is
unavailable, the BMR is used. If the total is less than 20% greater than BMR
then the EER (cals < EER * 0.8) is used. EER never used to calculate calories
for today.
#### Using BMR Formula
Fitbit uses the standard MD Mifflin-St Jeor equation:
#### EER Formula (TEE total energy expenditure)
The EER Formula is based on
<http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2006/oct/pdf/06_0034.pdf>, which in turn is
based on "Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary reference intakes for energy,
carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids
(macronutrients). Washington (DC): National Academy Press; 2005."

#### MALE-based EER Formula:
#### FEMALE-based EER Formula:
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length.

### Localizing the consent page
The Fitbit consent page supports localization. Since it is just a web form,
the text is translated based on the user's "Language by Region/Country"
setting in their Fitbit account. The user's device or browser language
settings may translate the consent language, as well. We do not support a
query parameter that forces language conversion.

## Additional Information
You can read more about data accuracy in the **Clinical Study** section of the
[Fitbit ECG App Instructions for
Use](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14253977#samd).
Additional information about the Fitbit ECG app can be found in the help
article [What is the Fitbit ECG
app?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236718).
### Limit / Offset
ECG data is very large because of the waveforms. Because of this, we cannot
query and return large numbers of ECG results, and limit the number of results
to 10. The offset query parameter is not fully supported and it's future is
unknown. Therefore, the only supported value is 0. Using the "offset" query
parameter in any other capacity could cause your application to break.
To paginate, request the next and previous links in the pagination response
object. The next and previous link should include afterDate or beforeDate
parameters of the datetime for the last reading in each page.
### Collecting ECG data
Before taking your first reading, review the Heart Rhythm Assessment. The
Heart Rhythm Assessment is found in the Fitbit mobile application.
Instructions can be found in the section "How do I use the Fitbit ECG app?"
within the help article [What is the Fitbit ECG
app?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236718).
### Classification of ECG results
After the user takes a 30 second ECG reading or spot check, Fitbit classifies
the user's heart rhythm as one of the 5 results:
  * **Atrial fibrillation (AFib)** : Your heart rhythm shows signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm. AFib can have serious health effects. You should contact your doctor.
  * **Normal sinus rhythm (NSR)** : Your heart rhythm appears normal. It doesn’t show signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm.

### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.

### "logType" values
The source of the activity log can be determined by the _logType_ response
element.
  * `auto_detected` activity logs are those created by Fitbit’s SmartTrack feature.
  * `manual` activity logs are user specified overrides of some or all tracker data.
  * `mobile_run` activity logs are created after completing a MobileRun.
  * `tracker` activity logs are those created using the multisport exercise mode on a Fitbit device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length).

### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

**state**
_recommended_ | Provides any state that might be useful to your application when the user is redirected back to your application. This parameter will be added to the redirect URI exactly as your application specifies. Fitbit strongly recommend including an anti-forgery token in this parameter and confirming its value in the redirect to mitigate against cross-site request forgery (CSRF). **Type:** string
**code_challenge**
(For use with PKCE only)
_optional / required_ | The code challenge is derived from the code verifier by using a transformation on the code verifier. The code verifier is a cryptographically random string dynamically created for each authorization request. The available transformations are `S256 ` and `plain`. `S256`: must be used if supported by the client:
_code_challenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))_.
`plain`: does not mitigate as wide a range of attacks as `S256` and may be
used only if the client cannot technically support `S256`: _code_challenge =
code_verifier_. **Default:** plain **Type:** string
**code_challenge_method**

## Additional Information
### Subscription Support for Temperature (Core)
Temperature (Core) does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). This data
is manually entered by the user, so we don’t believe it will change
frequently. We recommend querying Temperature (Core) data once or twice a day
to determine if new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight). However,
the frequency or rate at which you query Temperature (Core) data should be
based on your specific use cases and with this in mind.
### Rate limit
The Temperature (core) endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See
[Rate Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-
design/#Rate-Limits).
### Device compatibility
Temperature (Core) data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This
gives the user secure and transparent control over their data.

#### Considerations
  * Only the current goals are returned.
  * Floors goal only returned for users who currently or have previously paired a Fitbit device with an altimeter.
  * Calories out goal represents either dynamic daily target from the Premium trainer plan or manual calorie burn goal.
The default daily goal values are:
  * 10 floors;
  * 30 active minutes; and
  * Calories out is user specific, which accounts for BMR.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.

## Additional Information
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

## Additional Information
The response if provided in the format requested using units in the unit
system which corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
A recent activity record contains the distance and duration values recorded
during the last time the activity was logged. The record retrieved can be used
to log the activity via the Log Activity endpoint with the same or adjusted
values for distance and duration.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data.

【Context No.53】
This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

**Response Type**
HTTP Status Code | HTTP response code. List of codes are found in the [Troubleshooting Guide](/build/reference/web-api/troubleshooting-guide/error-messages/).
---|---
Status Message | Description of the status code.
Response Body | Contains the JSON response to the API call. When errors are returned by the API call, the errorType, fieldName and message text will provide more information to the cause of the failure.
**Response Codes**
200 | Returned if the given user is already subscribed to the stream using the same subscription ID.
---|---
201 | Returned if a new subscription was created in response to your request.
409 | Returned if the given user is already subscribed to this stream using a different subscription ID, OR if the given subscription ID is already used to identify a subscription to a different stream.
**Conflicts**
A single user can only subscribe to the same stream once. If a conflict arises
trying to add a subscription, the server will respond with an HTTP 409
Conflict. It will still return the same response elements, but in this case,
the body will tell you that the subscription already exists so that corrective
action must be taken.

## Output Indicator
Ensure that, except for the parts modified to follow the latest specifications, the structure and format of the code remain identical to the original code. Here, "identical" means that there should be no differences (diff) whatsoever, including in indentation, spaces, line breaks, and code structure, which should all be exactly the same as the original.
If there are any changes beyond the modified sections, this is considered incorrect.
Also, verify that the modified code conforms to the latest specifications.
