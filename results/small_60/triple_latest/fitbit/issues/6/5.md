【Context No.1】
## Sleep Time Series (Deprecated)
**Note:** This API has been deprecated with the introduction of version 1.2 of
the Sleep APIs described above. Sleep Stages data cannot be retrieved with
this API. If your application requires data consistency while you transition
over to the version 1.2 Sleep APIs, you can get this data through the [version
1 Get Sleep Logs by Date endpoint](/build/reference/web-api/sleep-v1/#get-
sleep-logs-by-date).
The **Get Sleep Time Series** endpoint returns time series data in the
specified range for a given resource in the format requested using units in
the [unit system](/build/reference/web-api/basics#units) that corresponds to
the Accept-Language header provided.
**Note:** Even if you provide earlier dates in the request, the response
retrieves only data since the user's join date or the first log entry date for
the requested collection.
#### Resource URL
There are two acceptable formats for retrieving intraday data:

    GET https://api.fitbit.com/1/user/[user-id]/[resource-path]/date/[date]/[period].json

**api-version** | The API version. Currently version **1**.
---|---
**user-id** | The encoded ID of the user. Use "-" (dash) for current logged-in user.
**resource-path** | The resource path; see the **Resource Path Options** below for a list of options.
**date** | The end date of the period specified in the format **yyyy-MM-dd** or **today**.
**period** | The range for which data will be returned. Options are **1d, 7d, 30d, 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y,** or **max.**

    GET https://api.fitbit.com/1/user/[user-id]/[resource-path]/date/[base-date]/[end-date].json

**api-version** | The API version. Currently version **1**.
---|---
**user-id** | The encoded ID of the user. Use "-" (dash) for current logged-in user.

【Context No.1】
Heart rate data recorded by the device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).

  * **activityCalories** \- The number of calories burned during the day for periods of time when the user was active above sedentary level. This value is calculated minute by minute for minutes that fall within this criteria. This includes activity burned calories and BMR.
  * **tracker/calories** \- Calories burned inclusive of BMR according to movement captured by a Fitbit tracker.

The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data.

5. If BMR or EER have been used to estimate calories for the whole specific day (no tracker data), intraday data for calories would be flat and estimated according to the simple equation **calories_1m = BMR(EER)/24/60.**
#### Using BMR/EER Algorithms
If a user had no Fitbit tracker data for the specific day then the greater of
Logged Activities + BMR (for minutes when there is no activity) and the
calories calculated from the EER for that day (if EER enabled for this user's
profile) are taken. In case, there was some data from the tracker for the
specific day, that data where available is used and for time where data is
unavailable, the BMR is used. If the total is less than 20% greater than BMR
then the EER (cals < EER * 0.8) is used. EER never used to calculate calories
for today.
#### Using BMR Formula
Fitbit uses the standard MD Mifflin-St Jeor equation:
#### EER Formula (TEE total energy expenditure)
The EER Formula is based on
<http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2006/oct/pdf/06_0034.pdf>, which in turn is
based on "Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary reference intakes for energy,
carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids
(macronutrients). Washington (DC): National Academy Press; 2005."
[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309085373&page=204](http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309085373&page=204)
#### MALE-based EER Formula:
#### FEMALE-based EER Formula:
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length.

`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.

activity?

【Context No.27】
This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

**code_challenge**
(For use with PKCE only)
_optional / required_ | The code challenge is derived from the code verifier by using a transformation on the code verifier. The code verifier is a cryptographically random string dynamically created for each authorization request. The available transformations are `S256 ` and `plain`. `S256`: must be used if supported by the client:
_code_challenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))_.
`plain`: does not mitigate as wide a range of attacks as `S256` and may be
used only if the client cannot technically support `S256`: _code_challenge =
code_verifier_. **Default:** plain **Type:** string
**code_challenge_method**
(For use with PKCE only)
_optional_ | Code verifier transformation method is `S256` or `plain`. **Default:** plain **Type:** string

#### Considerations
  * Only the current goals are returned.
  * Floors goal only returned for users who currently or have previously paired a Fitbit device with an altimeter.
  * Calories out goal represents either dynamic daily target from the Premium trainer plan or manual calorie burn goal.
The default daily goal values are:
  * 10 floors;
  * 30 active minutes; and
  * Calories out is user specific, which accounts for BMR.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.

### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

### Subscription Support for SpO2
SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

## Additional Information
### Localizing the consent page
The Fitbit consent page supports localization. Since it is just a web form,
the text is translated based on the user's "Language by Region/Country"
setting in their Fitbit account. The user's device or browser language
settings may translate the consent language, as well. We do not support a
query parameter that forces language conversion.

SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

## Output Indicator
Ensure that, except for the parts modified to follow the latest specifications, the structure and format of the code remain identical to the original code. Here, "identical" means that there should be no differences (diff) whatsoever, including in indentation, spaces, line breaks, and code structure, which should all be exactly the same as the original.
If there are any changes beyond the modified sections, this is considered incorrect.
Also, verify that the modified code conforms to the latest specifications.
