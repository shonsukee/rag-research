Please follow the guidelines below to make the necessary modifications.

### Modification Procedure
1. Analyze the deprecated specifications based on `### Technical Specifications for deprecated natural language` and `### Technical Specifications for deprecated code`.
2. Based on the analysis in step 1., identify code snippets that follow deprecated specifications within the source code in `## Input Code`.
3. Analyze the latest specifications based on `### Technical Specifications for latest natural language` and `### Technical Specifications for latest code`.
4. Modify the code snippets identified in step 2. to follow the latest specifications analyzed in step 3., while paying attention to the points listed in `### Attention` below.

### Attention
There may be multiple code snippets following deprecated specifications within `## Input Code`.
Only refer to the information in `### Technical Specifications for Latest natural language` and `### Technical Specifications for Latest code` when making modifications.
Do not perform refactoring or add comments; only modify the parts of the code that follow deprecated specifications to conform to the latest specifications.
Copy the source code from `## Input Code` before making modifications.
Delete all parts only according to the deprecated specification and modify the code to conform to the latest specification.
Only modify the parts of the code that follow deprecated specifications.
If no deprecated specification is found in the source code of the `## Input Code`, compare the source code with the latest specification to identify any differences. If modifications are required, modify the source code according to the latest specification.
Make sure to modify all code that follows deprecated specifications.
After modifications, ensure that all code following deprecated specifications has been replaced with code that conforms to the latest specifications.
If multiple deprecated specifications are present within `## Input Code`, confirm that all are unified under the latest specifications.

# Sleep Logs Version 1 (Deprecated)
## Overview
These endpoints are deprecated and support for them may end unexpectedly. If
your application does not depend on the sleep as calculated by these
endpoints, please use the new [v1.2 sleep endpoints](/build/reference/web-
api/sleep/).
> **Note** : Version 1 APIs **do not** support Sleep Stages data
## Get Sleep Logs by Date
The **Get Sleep Logs by Date** endpoint returns a summary and list of a user's
sleep log entries (including naps) as well as detailed sleep entry data for a
given day.
The relationship between sleep log entry properties is expressed with the
following equation:
#### Resource URL
URL parameters:
**user-id** | The ID of the user. Use "-" (dash) for current logged-in user.
---|---
**date** | The date of records to be returned. In the format **yyyy-MM-dd**.
#### Example Request
#### Example Response
**Note:** The text within the brackets `<>` is a descriptive placeholder for a
value or repeated elements. Also, values for **minuteData** can be **1**
("asleep"), **2** ("restless"), or **3** ("awake").
## Log Sleep
The **Log Sleep** endpoint creates a log entry for a sleep event and returns a
response in the format requested. Keep in mind that it is **NOT** possible to
create overlapping log entries. The **dateOfSleep** in the response for the
sleep log is the date on which the sleep event ends.
#### Resource URL
**user-id** | The ID of the user. Use "-" (dash) for current logged-in user.
---|---
#### POST Parameters
**startTime** | **required** | Start time; hours and minutes in the format **HH:mm**.
---|---|---
**duration** | **required** | Duration in milliseconds.
**date** | **required** | Log entry date in the format **yyyy-MM-dd**.
#### Example Request
#### Example Response
**Note:** The text within the brackets `<>` is a descriptive placeholder for a
value or repeated elements.
## Delete Sleep Log
The **Delete Sleep Log** endpoint deletes a user's sleep log entry with the
given ID.
#### Resource URL
**user-id** | The encoded ID of the user. Use "-" (dash) for current logged-in user.
---|---
**log-id** | ID of the sleep log to be deleted.
#### Response
A successful request will return a **204** status code with an empty response
body.
## Sleep Time Series (Deprecated)
**Note:** This API has been deprecated with the introduction of version 1.2 of
the Sleep APIs described above. Sleep Stages data cannot be retrieved with
this API. If your application requires data consistency while you transition
over to the version 1.2 Sleep APIs, you can get this data through the [version
1 Get Sleep Logs by Date endpoint](/build/reference/web-api/sleep-v1/#get-
sleep-logs-by-date).
The **Get Sleep Time Series** endpoint returns time series data in the
specified range for a given resource in the format requested using units in
the [unit system](/build/reference/web-api/basics#units) that corresponds to
the Accept-Language header provided.
**Note:** Even if you provide earlier dates in the request, the response
retrieves only data since the user's join date or the first log entry date for
the requested collection.
#### Resource URL
There are two acceptable formats for retrieving intraday data:
**api-version** | The API version. Currently version **1**.
---|---
**user-id** | The encoded ID of the user. Use "-" (dash) for current logged-in user.
**resource-path** | The resource path; see the **Resource Path Options** below for a list of options.
**date** | The end date of the period specified in the format **yyyy-MM-dd** or **today**.
**period** | The range for which data will be returned. Options are **1d, 7d, 30d, 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y,** or **max.**
**api-version** | The API version. Currently version **1**.
---|---
**user-id** | The encoded ID of the user. Use "-" (dash) for current logged-in user.
**resource-path** | The resource path; see the **Resource Path Options** below for a list of options.
**base-date** | The range start date, in the format **yyyy-MM-dd** or **today**.
**end-date** | The end date of the range.
#### Resource Path Options
#### Example Requests
#### Request Headers
**Accept-Language** | optional | The language to use for response values. Language is used to determine the food measurement units returned.

2. For the current day we will include only values until current timestamp (in the user's timezone).
  3. If a specific time interval was passed to the call via **start-time/end-time** parameters, **data-value** will include a summary only for the requested time period (versus whole day).
  4. For the **activities/log/calories** resource, each data point also includes the **level** field that reflects calculated activity level for that time period **( 0 - sedentary; 1 - lightly active; 2 - fairly active; 3 - very active)**.
  5. If BMR or EER have been used to estimate calories for the whole specific day (no tracker data), intraday data for calories would be flat and estimated according to the simple equation **calories_1m = BMR(EER)/24/60.**
#### Using BMR/EER Algorithms
If a user had no Fitbit tracker data for the specific day then the greater of
Logged Activities + BMR (for minutes when there is no activity) and the
calories calculated from the EER for that day (if EER enabled for this user's
profile) are taken. In case, there was some data from the tracker for the
specific day, that data where available is used and for time where data is
unavailable, the BMR is used. If the total is less than 20% greater than BMR
then the EER (cals < EER * 0.8) is used. EER never used to calculate calories
for today.
#### Using BMR Formula
Fitbit uses the standard MD Mifflin-St Jeor equation:
#### EER Formula (TEE total energy expenditure)
The EER Formula is based on
<http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2006/oct/pdf/06_0034.pdf>, which in turn is
based on "Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary reference intakes for energy,
carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids
(macronutrients). Washington (DC): National Academy Press; 2005."

### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

## Additional Information
TCX returns GPS and heart rate data which are tied to the GPS data points. If
you only want heart rate, see [Heart Rate Intraday Time
Series](/build/reference/web-api/intraday/).
To retrieve the TCX data without GPS data, use the endpoint's query parameter
`includePartialTCX=true`. If the exercise does not contain GPS data, the
lowest heart rate granularity available is 1 minute.
#### Finding an activity's "log id"
The activity's log-id can be found 2 ways:
  * Programmatically, execute the [Get Activity Log List](/build/reference/web-api/activity/get-activity-log-list/) endpoint. Get the value of the `logId` element for each exercise returned.
  * Non-programmatically, find the list of activity logs in the Fitbit web application. Click on the "View Details" button next to each activity. The activity log ID will be displayed in the URL, e.g. 213560689 in https://[www.fitbit.com/activities/exercise/213560689](http://www.fitbit.com/activities/exercise/213560689).
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`

that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise

## Additional Information
Knowing when a Fitbit device last synced with the Fitbit server is useful when
diagnosing reports that the Fitbit app is showing different values from what
the Fitbit Web API returns. Fitbit's own apps use the same Web API available
to third-party developers. However, when an active Bluetooth connection is
available, Fitbit's apps will show the summary values displayed on the device.
Often, this data has not yet synced with Fitbit's servers.
Third-party applications can check when a Fitbit device last synced with
Fitbit's servers using this endpoint.
For information on supporting users who have multiple devices paired with
their account, see [Multi-Device Overview](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/best-practices/#Multi-Device-Overview).

## Additional Information
Access to the Intraday Time Series for personal use (accessing your own data)
is available through the "Personal" App Type.
**Restriction** : Heart Rate Intraday data cannot be retrieved for more than a
24 hour period. Any requests that expand over a 24 hour period will result
with the summary data for the date range specified.
The heart rate intraday time series data is returned in the format requested.
The endpoint mimics the Get Heart Rate Time Series endpoints. If your
application has the appropriate access, your calls to a time series endpoint
for a specific day (by using start and end dates on the same day or a period
of 24 hours), the response will include extended intraday values with
1-second, 1-minute, 5-minute or 15-minute detail level for that day. Unlike
other time series calls that allow fetching data of other users, intraday data
is available only for and to the authorized user.
The "1sec" detail-level may not always return data in 1 second sampling
outside of a recorded exercise. Sampling is more granular during exercise to
provide accuracy. To fetch the granular heart rate during an exercise, query
data using the [GET Activity TCX endpoint](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-tcx/).
### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

## Additional Information
The activity log entries for a given day are displayed in the format requested
using units in the unit system corresponding to the Accept-Language header
provided.
#### Considerations
  * User data is only available since the user's join date or the first log entry date for the requested collection.
  * The tracker/... resource represents the daily activity values logged by the tracker device only, excluding manual activity log entires.
  * The tracker/calories resource does not include the Estimated Energy Requirement for calories estimation (EER) calculations for any dates even if they are turned on for the user's profile and use BMR level instead.
  * Elevation time series (/elevation, /floors) are only available for users with compatible trackers.
  * The activities collection are maintained for backwards compatible resource URLs (e.g. (activities/log/calories)).

**Calorie Time Series Differences**
  * **calories** \- The top level time series for calories burned inclusive of BMR, tracked activity, and manually logged activities.
  * **caloriesBMR** \- Value includes only [BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) calories.
  * **activityCalories** \- The number of calories burned during the day for periods of time when the user was active above sedentary level. This value is calculated minute by minute for minutes that fall within this criteria. This includes activity burned calories and BMR.
  * **tracker/calories** \- Calories burned inclusive of BMR according to movement captured by a Fitbit tracker.
  * **tracker/activityCalories** \- Calculated similarly to _activityCalories_ , but uses only tracker data. Manually logged activities are excluded.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

## Additional Information
Access to the Intraday Time Series for personal use (accessing your own data)
is available through the "Personal" App Type.
**Restriction** : Activity Intraday data cannot be retrieved for more than a
24 hour period. Any requests that expand over a 24 hour period will result
with the summary data for the date range specified.
The activity intraday time series data for a given resource is returned in the
format requested. The endpoint mimics the Get Activity Time Series endpoints.
If your application has the appropriate access, your calls to a time series
endpoint for a specific day (by using start and end dates on the same day or a
period of 24 hours), the response will include extended intraday values with
1-minute, 5-minute or 15-minute detail level for that day. Unlike other time
series calls that allow fetching data of other users, intraday data is
available only for and to the authorized user.
Any discrepancies between time series detail-level totals vs daily summary
totals is likely due to how the device calculates on-wrist and off-wrist data.
On-wrist data is defined as data collected while the device is worn. On-wrist
data is also referred to as Intraday data. Off-wrist data is defined as data
collected while the device is not worn. For example, step data can be
collected if the device was in a bag while driving down a bumpy road. By
design, daily summary totals include on-wrist totals and off-wrist totals;
while Intraday totals include on-wrist totals only.
#### Considerations
  1. If a user hasn't synced a tracker for more than seven (7) days, the tracker stores only summary values for the days older than one week. In this case, the intraday data for steps is zero and the intraday calories are calculated from BMR or EER. Intraday steps could be estimated from the total daily summary data by the equation above.
  2. For the current day we will include only values until current timestamp (in the user's timezone).
  3. If a specific time interval was passed to the call via **start-time/end-time** parameters, **data-value** will include a summary only for the requested time period (versus whole day).
  4. For the **activities/log/calories** resource, each data point also includes the **level** field that reflects calculated activity level for that time period **( 0 - sedentary; 1 - lightly active; 2 - fairly active; 3 - very active)**.
  5. If BMR or EER have been used to estimate calories for the whole specific day (no tracker data), intraday data for calories would be flat and estimated according to the simple equation **calories_1m = BMR(EER)/24/60.**
#### Using BMR/EER Algorithms
If a user had no Fitbit tracker data for the specific day then the greater of
Logged Activities + BMR (for minutes when there is no activity) and the
calories calculated from the EER for that day (if EER enabled for this user's
profile) are taken.

# Get HRV Summary by Interval
This endpoint returns the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data for a date range.
HRV data applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep,” which is the longest
single period of time asleep on a given date.
Single date measurements are provided at the end of a period of sleep. The
data returned can and often does reflects a sleep period that began the day
before. For example, if you request a daily HRV rate for 2021-12-22, it may
include measurements that were taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the
user fell asleep.
It uses [units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
The value returned does not apply to a single date, necessarily, but to a
measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users, this will span two
dates to account for the HRV values on the date at which the summary was
provided, as well as during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting HRV data
HRV data is collected when the following conditions have been met:
  * the Health Metrics tile in the user's mobile application dashboard is enabled.
  * the data is only collected when the user is sleeping.
  * the user must have a minimum of 3 hours of sleep.
  * during the main sleep period, a sleep stages log is created.
If any of these items do not occur, then HRV data will not be collected.
For HRV, a HTTP status 200 means the endpoint executed successfully regardless
if data exists. A premium subscription is not needed for the Health Metrics
tile or HRV data collection.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s HRV value. Recording the data
while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect HRV data. Data is only processed when the user is still. If a user
moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can prevent HRV data
from being processed correctly. In addition, if recorded data is incapable of
computing specific sleep stages for a period of sleep, this will compromise
the user’s ability to retrieve an HRV value.
The device automatically stops collecting HRV data after it determines the
user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their
device, HRV data will begin processing for that sleep period. It usually takes
up to 15 minutes for the HRV data to be processed and made available to
download.
You can read more about **data accuracy** on
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00493-6>
### Subscription Support for HRV
HRV does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since HRV is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the HRV data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the HRV data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The HRV endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
HRV data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support HRV data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports HRV.

# Get HRV Intraday by Interval
This endpoint returns the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) intraday data for a
date range. HRV data applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep,” which is
the longest single period of time asleep on a given date. It measures your HRV
rate at various times and returns Root Mean Square of Successive Differences
(rmssd), Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF), and Coverage data for a
given measurement. Rmssd measures short-term variability in your heart rate
while asleep. LF and HF capture the power in interbeat interval fluctuations
within either high frequency or low frequency bands. Finally, coverage refers
to data completeness in terms of the number of interbeat intervals.
Single date measurements are provided at the end of a period of sleep. The
data returned can and often does reflects a sleep period that began the day
before. For example, if you request a daily HRV rate for 2021-12-22, it may
include measurements that were taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the

## Additional Information
Access to the Intraday Time Series for personal use (accessing your own data)
is available through the "Personal" App Type.
**Restriction** : Activity Intraday data cannot be retrieved for more than a
24 hour period. Any requests that expand over a 24 hour period will result
with the summary data for the date range specified.
The activity intraday time series data for a given resource is returned in the
format requested. The endpoint mimics the Get Activity Time Series endpoints.
If your application has the appropriate access, your calls to a time series
endpoint for a specific day (by using start and end dates on the same day or a
period of 24 hours), the response will include extended intraday values with
1-minute, 5-minute or 15-minute detail level for that day. Unlike other time
series calls that allow fetching data of other users, intraday data is
available only for and to the authorized user.
Any discrepancies between time series detail-level totals vs daily summary
totals is likely due to how the device calculates on-wrist and off-wrist data.
On-wrist data is defined as data collected while the device is worn. On-wrist
data is also referred to as Intraday data. Off-wrist data is defined as data
collected while the device is not worn. For example, step data can be
collected if the device was in a bag while driving down a bumpy road. By
design, daily summary totals include on-wrist totals and off-wrist totals;
while Intraday totals include on-wrist totals only.
#### Considerations
  1. If a user hasn't synced a tracker for more than seven (7) days, the tracker stores only summary values for the days older than one week. In this case, the intraday data for steps is zero and the intraday calories are calculated from BMR or EER. Intraday steps could be estimated from the total daily summary data by the equation above.
  2. For the current day we will include only values until current timestamp (in the user's timezone).
  3. If a specific time interval was passed to the call via **start-time/end-time** parameters, **data-value** will include a summary only for the requested time period (versus whole day).
  4. For the **activities/log/calories** resource, each data point also includes the **level** field that reflects calculated activity level for that time period **( 0 - sedentary; 1 - lightly active; 2 - fairly active; 3 - very active)**.
  5. If BMR or EER have been used to estimate calories for the whole specific day (no tracker data), intraday data for calories would be flat and estimated according to the simple equation **calories_1m = BMR(EER)/24/60.

# Get SpO2 Intraday by Interval
This endpoint returns the SpO2 intraday data for a specified date range. SpO2
applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep”, which is the longest single
period of time asleep on a given date. Spo2 values are calculated on a
5-minute exponentially-moving average.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For example, if you
request SpO2 levels for 2021-12-22, it may include measurements that were
taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user fell asleep.
The data returned includes the percentage value of SpO2 in your bloodstream
and an accurate timestamp for that measurement. It also uses
[units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Unit-
Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.

## Additional Information
Interval Intraday values reflect SpO2 measurement taken for periods of sleep
between two dates. For most users, intraday values will span multiple dates to
account for SpO2 levels on the date at which the summary was provided, and
SpO2 levels during the previous night’s sleep.
Keep in mind, the intraday intervals have a maximum date range of 30 days.
Entering a date range that exceeds 30 days will return a 400 Bad Request
response code.
### Collecting SpO2 data
SpO2 data is collected when the user is in an extended period of sleep. There
are many factors that can affect a user’s SpO2 value. Recording the data while
a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect SpO2 data. An extended sleep period is considered to be at least 3
hours of quality sleep. In addition, data is only processed when the user is
still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can
prevent SpO2 data from processing. See help article [How do I track blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2) with my Fitbit
device?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226120) for more
information on SpO2 data processing on the Fitbit device.
The device stops collecting SpO2 data after it determines the user is awake,
typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their device, we
will begin processing the SpO2 data for that sleep period. It can take up to 1
hour for the SpO2 data to be processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for SpO2
SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
Interval values reflect breathing rate measurements taken for periods of sleep
between two dates. For most users, values will span multiple dates to account
for breathing rates on the date at which the summary was provided, and during
the previous night’s sleep.
### Sleep Stages
Intraday breathing rate data is categorized by sleep stage. This gives users a
sense of how their average breathing rate differs depending on the type of
sleep they were in during a sleep cycle. In cases where a sleep period value
could not be calculated due to lack of data, a "-1.0" will be returned.
Click [here](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236712) to learn more
about the light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep stages.
### Collecting breathing rate data
Breathing rate data is collected when the user is in an extended period of
sleep of at least 3 hours.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s breathing rate value.
Recording the data while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to
correctly and accurately collect breathing rate data. Data is only processed
when the user is still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too
short, this can prevent breathing rate data from being processed correctly. In
addition, if recorded data is incapable of computing specific sleep stages for
a period of sleep, this will compromise the user’s ability to retrieve a
breathing rate value.
The device automatically stops collecting breathing rate data after it
determines the user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the
user syncs their device, breathing rate data will begin processing for that
sleep period. It usually takes up to 15 minutes for the breathing rate data to
be processed and made available to download.

## Additional Information
### Alert Filtering
We will only reveal AFib alerts that have been opened by the user in the
Fitbit app. See [How do Fitbit Irregular Rhythm Notifications check for atrial
fibrillation
(AFib)?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236719?hl=en&sjid=16520403461986358893-NA)
It is important that the user is first aware of this notification and
understands its importance to their health. The app explains to the user what
an IRN is and that the notification is not a diagnosis. Once the user
interacts with the notification, the information is shared via API.
### Limit / Offset
The IRN data set is very large. Because of this, we cannot query and return
large numbers of IRN results, and limit the number of results to 10. The
offset query parameter is not fully supported and its future is unknown.
Therefore, the only supported value is 0. Using the "offset" query parameter
in any other capacity could cause your application to break.
To paginate, request the next and previous links in the pagination response
object. The next and previous link should include afterDate or beforeDate
parameters of the datetime for the last reading in each page.
### Subscription Support for IRN
IRN does not support subscription notifications (webhooks). We recommend
querying IRN data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight). However, the frequency or rate at which you query
IRN data should be based on your specific use cases and with this in mind.
### Rate limit
The IRN endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The IRN data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support IRN data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/technology/irregular-rhythm) page to
determine if your specific device supports IRN.

## Additional Information
### Types of sleep logs
This endpoint supports two kinds of sleep log types:
  1. stages : Levels data is returned with 30-second granularity. 'Sleep Stages' levels include deep, light, rem, and wake.
  2. classic : Levels data returned with 60-second granularity. 'Sleep Pattern' levels include asleep, restless, and awake.
> **Note:** shortData is only included for stages sleep logs and includes wake
> periods that are 3 minutes or less in duration. This distinction is to
> simplify graphically distinguishing short wakes from longer wakes, but they
> are physiologically equivalent.
For information on how to interpret the sleep data, see [Interpreting the
Sleep Stage and Short Data](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/best-
practices/#Interpreting-the-Sleep-Stage-and-Short-Data).
### Sleep Efficiency Calculation
The sleep log response will return a sleep efficiency score. Sleep efficiency
is supported for classic sleep logs, only. Even though a value may be returned
for both classic and stage sleep logs, the sleep efficiency value returned for
stages sleep logs should be ignored. Sleep efficiency for classic sleep logs
uses the standard calculation of
> **Note:** The sleep efficiency score should not be confused with the sleep
> score returned by the mobile application, as they are calculated
> differently. Sleep score is not supported through the Web API.
### Device generated sleep logs
The `dateOfSleep` in the GET sleep log endpoint response is the date on which
the sleep event ends. This means that requesting a sleep log for a given date,
for example 2021-12-22, may return a log entry that began the previous night
on 2021-12-21. This is to account for the fact that sleep periods typically
take place overnight between two dates and the dateOfSleep refers to the date
the user woke up.
If the wake time during the main sleep is greater than 1 hour, the sleep log
will be split into 2 logs.
Although, if the device syncs during the wake time and consistent steps and
hand movement occur for at least 15 minutes, then a sleep log might be
generated for the first part of the sleep. The second part of the sleep will
be detected when the device syncs in the morning. If the time between the 2
sleep logs is less than 1 hour, the 2 sleep logs will be stitched together.

# Get SpO2 Intraday by Date
This endpoint returns the SpO2 intraday data for a single date. SpO2 applies
specifically to a user’s “main sleep”, which is the longest single period of
time asleep on a given date. Spo2 values are calculated on a 5-minute
exponentially-moving average.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For example, if you
request SpO2 levels for 2021-12-22, it may include measurements that were
taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user fell asleep.
The data returned includes the percentage value of SpO2 in your bloodstream
and an accurate timestamp for that measurement. It also uses
[units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Unit-
Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.

## Additional Information
Intraday values reflect SpO2 measurement taken for a period of sleep. For most
users, intraday values will span multiple dates to account for SpO2 levels on
the date at which the summary was provided, and SpO2 levels during the
previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting SpO2 data
SpO2 data is collected when the user is in an extended period of sleep. There
are many factors that can affect a user’s SpO2 value. Recording the data while
a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect SpO2 data. An extended sleep period is considered to be at least 3
hours of quality sleep. In addition, data is only processed when the user is
still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can
prevent SpO2 data from processing. See help article [How do I track blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2) with my Fitbit
device?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226120) for more
information on SpO2 data processing on the Fitbit device.
The device stops collecting SpO2 data after it determines the user is awake,
typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their device, we
will begin processing the SpO2 data for that sleep period. It can take up to 1
hour for the SpO2 data to be processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for SpO2
SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

include a detailed list of activity log entries.
#### Considerations
  1. Daily summary data and daily goals for elevation (elevation, floors) only included for users with a device with an altimeter.
  2. The steps field in activity log entries included only for activities that have steps (e.g. "Walking", "Running"); distance only included when it is relevant.
  3. Calorie burn goal (caloriesOut) represents either dynamic daily target from the premium trainer plan or manual calorie burn goal. Goals are included in the response only for today and 21 days in the past.
### Retrieving heart rate data within the activity response
The Heart Rate Zones data array can be displayed within this endpoint's
response. For this to occur, the following are required. If any of the items
are missing, the data array will not be displayed.
  1. The _heartrate_ scope enabled by the user.
  2. A heart rate enabled device paired to the user's account.
  3. Heart rate data recorded by the device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data.

# Get HRV Intraday by Date
This endpoint returns the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) intraday data for a
single date. HRV data applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep,” which is
the longest single period of time asleep on a given date. It measures the HRV
rate at various times and returns Root Mean Square of Successive Differences
(rmssd), Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF), and Coverage data for a
given measurement. Rmssd measures short-term variability in your heart rate
while asleep. LF and HF capture the power in interbeat interval fluctuations
within either high frequency or low frequency bands. Finally, coverage refers
to data completeness in terms of the number of interbeat intervals.
Single date measurements are provided at the end of a period of sleep. The
data returned usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For
example, if you request a daily HRV rate for 2021-12-22, it may include
measurements that were taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user
fell asleep.
It uses [units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-
design/#Unit-Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
The value returned does not apply to a single date, necessarily, but to a
measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users, this will span two
dates to account for the HRV values on the date at which the summary was
provided, as well as during the previous night’s sleep.
### Intraday data response frequency
HRV response data is returned every 5 minutes. This applies exclusively to
intraday endpoints.
### Collecting HRV data
HRV data is collected when the following conditions have been met:
  * the Health Metrics tile in the user's mobile application dashboard is enabled.
  * the data is only collected when the user is sleeping.
  * the user must have a minimum of 3 hours of sleep.
  * during the main sleep period, a sleep stages log is created.
If any of these items do not occur, then HRV data will not be collected.
For HRV, a HTTP status 200 means the endpoint executed successfully regardless
if data exists. A premium subscription is not needed for the Health Metrics
tile or HRV data collection.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s HRV value. Recording the data
while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect HRV data. Data is only processed when the user is still. If a user
moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can prevent HRV data
from being processed correctly. In addition, if recorded data is incapable of
computing specific sleep stages for a period of sleep, this will compromise
the user’s ability to retrieve an HRV value.
The device automatically stops collecting HRV data after it determines the
user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their
device, HRV data will begin processing for that sleep period. It usually takes
up to 15 minutes for the HRV data to be processed and made available to
download.
You can read more about **data accuracy** on
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00493-6>
### Subscription Support for HRV
HRV does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since HRV is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the HRV data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the HRV data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The HRV endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
HRV data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support HRV data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports HRV.

measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users, this will span two
dates to account for breathing rates on the date at which the summary was
provided, as well as during the previous night’s sleep.
### Sleep Stages
Intraday breathing rate data is categorized by sleep stage. This gives users a
sense of how their average breathing rate differs depending on the type of
sleep they were in during a sleep cycle. In cases where a sleep period value
could not be calculated due to lack of data, a "-1.0" will be returned.
Click [here](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236712) to learn more
about the light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep stages.
### Collecting breathing rate data
Breathing rate data is collected when the user is in an extended period of
sleep of at least 3 hours.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s breathing rate value.
Recording the data while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to
correctly and accurately collect breathing rate data. Data is only processed
when the user is still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too

## Additional Information
### Types of sleep logs
This endpoint supports two kinds of sleep log types:
  1. stages : Levels data is returned with 30-second granularity. 'Sleep Stages' levels include deep, light, rem, and wake.
  2. classic : Levels data returned with 60-second granularity. 'Sleep Pattern' levels include asleep, restless, and awake.
> **Note:** shortData is only included for stages sleep logs and includes wake
> periods that are 3 minutes or less in duration. This distinction is to
> simplify graphically distinguishing short wakes from longer wakes, but they
> are physiologically equivalent.
For information on how to interpret the sleep data, see [Interpreting the
Sleep Stage and Short Data](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/best-
practices/#Interpreting-the-Sleep-Stage-and-Short-Data).
### Sleep Efficiency Calculation
The sleep log response will return a sleep efficiency score. Sleep efficiency
is supported for classic sleep logs, only. Even though a value may be returned
for both classic and stage sleep logs, the sleep efficiency value returned for
stages sleep logs should be ignored. Sleep efficiency for classic sleep logs
uses the standard calculation of
> **Note:** The sleep efficiency score should not be confused with the sleep
> score returned by the mobile application, as they are calculated
> differently. Sleep score is not supported through the Web API.
### Device generated sleep logs
The `dateOfSleep` in the GET sleep log endpoint response is the date on which
the sleep event ends. This means that requesting a sleep log for a given date,
for example 2021-12-22, may return a log entry that began the previous night
on 2021-12-21. This is to account for the fact that sleep periods typically
take place overnight between two dates and the dateOfSleep refers to the date
the user woke up.
If the wake time during the main sleep is greater than 1 hour, the sleep log
will be split into 2 logs.
Although, if the device syncs during the wake time and consistent steps and
hand movement occur for at least 15 minutes, then a sleep log might be
generated for the first part of the sleep. The second part of the sleep will
be detected when the device syncs in the morning. If the time between the 2
sleep logs is less than 1 hour, the 2 sleep logs will be stitched together.

# Get SpO2 Summary by Interval
This endpoint returns the SpO2 summary data for a specified date range. SpO2
applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep”, which is the longest single
period of time asleep on a given date.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For example, if you
request SpO2 levels for 2021-12-22, it may include measurements that were
taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user fell asleep.
The data returned includes average, minimum, and maximum SpO2 levels. It uses
[units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Unit-
Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.

## Additional Information
The Interval Summary values reflect SpO2 measurements taken for sleep periods
between two dates. For most users, interval summaries may span multiple dates
to account for SpO2 levels on the date at which the summary was provided, and
SpO2 levels during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting SpO2 data
SpO2 data is collected when the user is in an extended period of sleep. There
are many factors that can affect a user’s SpO2 value. Recording the data while
a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect SpO2 data. An extended sleep period is considered to be at least 3
hours of quality sleep. In addition, data is only processed when the user is
still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can
prevent SpO2 data from processing. See help article [How do I track blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2) with my Fitbit
device?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226120) for more
information on SpO2 data processing on the Fitbit device.
The device stops collecting SpO2 data after it determines the user is awake,
typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their device, we
will begin processing the SpO2 data for that sleep period. It can take up to 1
hour for the SpO2 data to be processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for SpO2
SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
Interval values reflect breathing rate measurements taken for periods of sleep
between two dates. For most users, values will span multiple dates to account
for breathing rates on the date at which the summary was provided, and during
the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting breathing rate data
Breathing rate data is collected when the user is in an extended period of
sleep of at least 3 hours.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s breathing rate value.
Recording the data while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to
correctly and accurately collect breathing rate data. Data is only processed
when the user is still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too
short, this can prevent breathing rate data from being processed correctly. In
addition, if recorded data is incapable of computing specific sleep stages for
a period of sleep, this will compromise the user’s ability to retrieve a
breathing rate value.
The device automatically stops collecting breathing rate data after it
determines the user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the
user syncs their device, breathing rate data will begin processing for that
sleep period. It usually takes up to 15 minutes for the breathing rate data to
be processed and made available to download.

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
The value returned does not apply to a single date, necessarily, but to a
measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users, this will span two
dates to account for the HRV values on the date at which the summary was
provided, as well as during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting HRV data
HRV data is collected when the following conditions have been met:
  * the Health Metrics tile in the user's mobile application dashboard is enabled.
  * the data is only collected when the user is sleeping.
  * the user must have a minimum of 3 hours of sleep.
  * during the main sleep period, a sleep stages log is created.
If any of these items do not occur, then HRV data will not be collected.
For HRV, a HTTP status 200 means the endpoint executed successfully regardless
if data exists. A premium subscription is not needed for the Health Metrics
tile or HRV data collection.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s HRV value. Recording the data
while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect HRV data. Data is only processed when the user is still. If a user
moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can prevent HRV data
from being processed correctly. In addition, if recorded data is incapable of
computing specific sleep stages for a period of sleep, this will compromise
the user’s ability to retrieve an HRV value.
The device automatically stops collecting HRV data after it determines the
user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their
device, HRV data will begin processing for that sleep period. It usually takes
up to 15 minutes for the HRV data to be processed and made available to

secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support HRV data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports HRV.

## Additional Information
### Subscription Support for AZM
Active Zone Minutes does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since AZM
is recorded during normal activity, the activity notification arrival time can
be used to estimate when changes to the AZM data is available.
### Rate limit
The AZM endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
AZM data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support AZM data collection. See the [Fitbit

## Additional Information
### Types of sleep logs
This endpoint supports two kinds of sleep log types:
  1. stages : Levels data is returned with 30-second granularity. 'Sleep Stages' levels include deep, light, rem, and wake.
  2. classic : Levels data returned with 60-second granularity. 'Sleep Pattern' levels include asleep, restless, and awake.
> **Note:** shortData is only included for stages sleep logs and includes wake
> periods that are 3 minutes or less in duration. This distinction is to
> simplify graphically distinguishing short wakes from longer wakes, but they
> are physiologically equivalent.
For information on how to interpret the sleep data, see [Interpreting the
Sleep Stage and Short Data](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/best-
practices/#Interpreting-the-Sleep-Stage-and-Short-Data).
### Sleep Efficiency Calculation
The sleep log response will return a sleep efficiency score. Sleep efficiency
is supported for classic sleep logs, only.

### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

  * Initiate the Client Credentials authorization flow (See [Client Credentials](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/client-credentials/)).
Fitbit follows the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow as specified in [RFC
6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4). This
authorization flow is used with specific Fitbit API endpoints related to
business operations. It is not supported by the public Web APIs to retrieve
Fitbit user data.
The Client Credentials Grant flow has the following steps:
  1. The application sends a request to https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token with its client_id and client_secret; and
  2. Fitbit authenticates your application and issues an access token.

# Get SpO2 Summary by Date
This endpoint returns the SpO2 summary data for a single date. SpO2 applies
specifically to a user’s “main sleep”, which is the longest single period of
time asleep on a given date.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For example, if you
request SpO2 levels for 2021-12-22, it may include measurements that were
taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user fell asleep.
The data returned includes average, minimum, and maximum SpO2 levels. It uses
[units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Unit-
Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.
**Scope:** _oxygen_saturation_

## Additional Information
The Single Date Summary value does not apply to a single date, necessarily,
but to an SpO2 measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users,
this will span two dates to account for SpO2 levels on the date at which the
summary was provided, and SpO2 levels during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting SpO2 data
SpO2 data is collected when the user is in an extended period of sleep. There
are many factors that can affect a user’s SpO2 value. Recording the data while
a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect SpO2 data. An extended sleep period is considered to be at least 3
hours of quality sleep. In addition, data is only processed when the user is
still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can
prevent SpO2 data from processing. See help article [How do I track blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2) with my Fitbit
device?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226120) for more
information on SpO2 data processing on the Fitbit device.
The device stops collecting SpO2 data after it determines the user is awake,
typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their device, we
will begin processing the SpO2 data for that sleep period. It can take up to 1
hour for the SpO2 data to be processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for SpO2
SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

## Additional Information
### JSON Web Tokens
Fitbit API access tokens use the JSON Web Token (JWT) format. Fitbit reserves
the right to change the contents and format of these tokens at any time.
Client applications should not create dependencies upon the token format.
Access tokens and refresh tokens may be up to 1,024 bytes in size.
### Web Browser Compatibility
The Fitbit API and its implementation of OAuth 2.0 are designed to work with
the current and one previous version of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft
Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. When a new version of a web browser is released,
Fitbit begins supporting that version and stop supporting the third most
recent version.

# Refresh Token
The /oauth2/token endpoint can do the following:
  * Exchange the authorization code for the initial access token and refresh token (See [OAuth2 Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/oauth2-token)).
This process is required when using the Authorization Code Grant Flow.
  * Obtain a new access token and refresh token when the existing access token has expired (See [Refresh Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/refresh-token/)).
  * Initiate the Client Credentials authorization flow (See [Client Credentials](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/client-credentials/)).
* * *

## Additional Information
An access token intentionally is short lived. This is an important security
mechanism of OAuth 2.0. When using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE]. By default, the access tokens have an eight-hour lifetime.
When an access token expires, an HTTP 401 error will be returned.
At this point, your application needs to refresh the access token. The Fitbit
API follows
[RFC6749](https<nolink>://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-6)
specification for refreshing access tokens. A refresh token does not expire
until it is used. The refresh token can only be used once, as a new refresh
token is returned with the new access token.
If the application makes identical refresh token requests within a two-minute
period, the Fitbit Web API will return the same response. This is to assist
applications unable to coordinate the refresh token flow between processes.
Alternatively, your application could redirect the user to the authentication
flow. If the user is signed in and the scopes requested match the previously
granted scopes, the user will be redirected to your redirect URL with a new
access token without being prompted.

## Additional Information
The response uses the measurement units as defined in the unit system, which
corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
#### Considerations
  * Only the current goals are returned.
  * Floors goal only returned for users who currently or have previously paired a Fitbit device with an altimeter.
  * Calories out goal represents either dynamic daily target from the Premium trainer plan or manual calorie burn goal.
The default daily goal values are:
  * 10 floors;
  * 30 active minutes; and
  * Calories out is user specific, which accounts for BMR.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.

AFib can have serious health effects. You should contact your doctor.
  * **Normal sinus rhythm (NSR)** : Your heart rhythm appears normal. It doesn’t show signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm.
  * **Inconclusive** : If your heart rate is over 120 bpm or under 50 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. There are many possible reasons for getting an inconclusive result, but common causes are moving too much during the assessment, not resting git stat your hands on a table, or other arrhythmia.
  * **Inconclusive: High heart rate** : If your heart rate is over 120 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. Heart rate can be high for many reasons, such as: recent exercise, stress, nervousness, alcohol, dehydration, infection, AFib, or other arrhythmia.
  * **Inconclusive: Low heart rate** : If your heart rate is under 50 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. Heart rate can be low for many reasons, such as: taking certain medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, having excellent aerobic fitness, or other arrhythmia.
### Subscription Support for ECG
ECG does not support subscription notifications (webhooks). We recommend
querying ECG data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight). However, the frequency or rate at which you query
ECG data should be based on your specific use cases and with this in mind.
### Rate limit
The ECG endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
ECG data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the data syncs with the Fitbit ECG
service.
Most of the current devices sold support ECG data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports ECG.

### Device support
The Fitbit devices have the ability to set an alarm. Older devices whose
alarms are configured in the mobile application support the create, delete,
get and update alarm endpoints. Newer devices, listed in this help article
<https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226604>, contain an on-device
alarm application, and do not support the alarm endpoints. The alarms for
these devices can only be set on the device itself.
Setting an alarm without a recurring schedule is intended for next day
purposes only.

## Additional Information
It is **NOT** possible to create overlapping log entries. The `dateOfSleep` in
the response for the sleep log is the date on which the sleep event ends.
This endpoint supports two kinds of sleep data:
  1. stages : Levels data is returned with 30-second granularity. 'Sleep Stages' levels include deep, light, rem, and wake.
  2. classic : Levels data returned with 60-second granularity. 'Sleep Pattern' levels include asleep, restless, and awake.
> **Note:** shortData is only included for stages sleep logs and includes wake
> periods that are 3 minutes or less in duration. This distinction is to
> simplify graphically distinguishing short wakes from longer wakes, but they
> are physiologically equivalent.
### Manually Created Sleep Logs
A manual sleep log is either a sleep log that has human input through the
mobile or web application, or a 3rd party application records sleep using the
[Create Sleep Log](/build/reference/web-api/sleep/create-sleep-log/) endpoint.
When a sleep log is manually recorded, a "classic" sleep log is generated.
Sleep "stage" logs use the device heart rate and movement to calculate sleep
stage data. When manually entering a sleep log, this information is typically
not available.

## Additional Information
This endpoint uses the units in the unit system which corresponds to the
Accept-Language header provided (or using optional custom distanceUnit) and
sends a JSON response in the format requested.
When specifying the **startTime** parameter value, do not include seconds.
Seconds is not a supported value and will return incorrect data when it is
included.
### Activity Types
Any activity log entry is based on one of the activities from the catalog of
activities. Though activities in catalog have a tree structure (i.e. divided
into categories like "Sports and Workouts", "Running" and subcategories like
"Bicycling", "Walking"), each activity leaf in the catalog can also have more
granular structure. Each leaf can have a directory activity type (and have
child intensity levels) or simple activity (have no levels). When creating a
new activity log entry, use the following types of objects to pass as the
activityId value:
  * **Directory activity id** : activity contains child activities which represents intensity levels (e.g. "Running").
  * **Intensity level id** : activity within directory activity (e.g. "Running/6.7mph (9 min/mile)").
  * **Simple activity id** : single activity without intensity levels (e.g. "Shoveling snow").
> **Note:** A list of activities can be retrieved via the Browse Activities
> endpoint.

### Custom Activities
In the process of creating a new activity log entry, it is possible to
seamlessly create a new custom activity for the user. This can be achieved by
using the second scenario for the set of POST parameters (providing
activityName instead of activityId). In this case, either existing custom
activity with the same name will be used for creating new log entry or a new
record created and then logged. As for custom activities on the website,
manualCalories must always provided with the activityName parameter among
other required fields.
> **Note:** "Steps" may be used as a distanceUnits value when the activity is
> either "Walking" (activityId=90013) or "Running" (activityId=90009) and
> distance is only included when it is relevant.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

# Get Breathing Rate Summary by Date
This endpoint returns average breathing rate data for a single date. Breathing
Rate data applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep,” which is the longest
single period of time during which they were asleep on a given date.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
can and often does reflect a sleep period that began the day before. For
example, if you request a daily breathing rate for 2021-12-22, it may include
measurements that were taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user
started to sleep.
It uses [units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
The value returned does not apply to a single date, necessarily, but to a
measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users, this will span two
dates to account for breathing rates on the date at which the summary was
provided, as well as during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting breathing rate data
Breathing rate data is collected when the user is in an extended period of
sleep of at least 3 hours.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s breathing rate value.
Recording the data while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to
correctly and accurately collect breathing rate data. Data is only processed
when the user is still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too
short, this can prevent breathing rate data from being processed correctly. In
addition, if recorded data is incapable of computing specific sleep stages for
a period of sleep, this will compromise the user’s ability to retrieve a
breathing rate value.
The device automatically stops collecting breathing rate data after it
determines the user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the
user syncs their device, breathing rate data will begin processing for that
sleep period. It usually takes up to 15 minutes for the breathing rate data to
be processed and made available to download.
You can read more about **data accuracy** on
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00493-6>
### Subscription Support for Breathing Rate
Breathing Rate does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since
Breathing Rate is recorded during periods of sleep, the sleep notification
arrival time can be used to estimate when the Breathing Rate data will be
available (See the "Collecting Data" section). For applications that do not
track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep data, we recommend querying the
Breathing Rate data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The breathing rate endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
Breathing rate data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives
the user secure and transparent control over their data. The data is
thenprocessed and made available through the API after the user syncs their
device with the Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support breathing rate data collection. See
the [Fitbit Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to
determine if your specific device supports breathing rate.

## Additional Information
### Device support
The Fitbit devices have the ability to set an alarm. Older devices whose
alarms are configured in the mobile application support the create, delete,
get and update alarm endpoints. Newer devices, listed in this help article
<https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226604>, contain an on-device
alarm application, and do not support the alarm endpoints. The alarms for
these devices can only be set on the device itself.
Setting an alarm without a recurring schedule is intended for next day
purposes only.

## Additional Information
The response if provided in the format requested using units in the unit
system which corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
A recent activity record contains the distance and duration values recorded
during the last time the activity was logged. The record retrieved can be used
to log the activity via the Log Activity endpoint with the same or adjusted
values for distance and duration.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.

activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more

# Get Temperature (Skin) Summary by Date
This endpoint returns the Temperature (Skin) data for a single date. It only
returns a value for dates on which the Fitbit device was able to record
Temperature (skin) data.
Temperature (Skin) data applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep,” which
is the longest single period of time asleep on a given date.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For example, if you
request a daily Temperature (Skin) rate for 2021-12-22, it may include
measurements that were taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user
fell asleep.
It uses [units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
The value returned does not apply to a single date, necessarily, but to a
measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users, this will span two
dates to account for Temperature (Skin) values on the date at which the
summary was provided, as well as during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting Temperature (Skin) data
Temperature (Skin) data is collected when the user is in an extended period of
sleep of at least 3 hours.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s Temperature (Skin) value.
Recording the data while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to
correctly and accurately collect Temperature (Skin) data. Data is only
processed when the user is still. If a user moves too much or their sleep
session is too short, this can prevent Temperature (Skin) data from being
processed correctly. In addition, if recorded data is incapable of computing
specific sleep stages for a period of sleep, this will compromise the user’s
ability to retrieve a Temperature (Skin) value.
The device automatically stops collecting Temperature (Skin) data after it
determines the user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the
user syncs their device, Temperature (Skin) data will begin processing for
that sleep period. It usually takes up to 15 minutes for the data to be
processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for Temperature (Skin)
Temperature (Skin) does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since
Temperature (Skin) is recorded during periods of sleep, the sleep notification
arrival time can be used to estimate when the Temperature (Skin) data will be
available (See the "[Collecting Data](/build/reference/web-
api/temperature/get-temperature-skin-summary-by-date/#Collecting-Temperature-
Skin-data)" section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot
retrieve sleep data, we recommend querying the Temperature (Skin) data once or
twice a day to determine if new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
However, the frequency or rate at which you query Temperature (Skin) data
should be based on your specific use cases and with this in mind.
### Rate limit
The Temperature (Skin) endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See
[Rate Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-
design/#Rate-Limits).
### Device compatibility
Temperature (Skin) data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This
gives the user secure and transparent control over their data. The data is
then processed and made available through the API after the user syncs their
device with the Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support Temperature (Skin) data collection.
See the [Fitbit Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to
determine if your specific device supports Temperature (Skin).
#### Temperature Sensors
Some Fitbit devices use a dedicated temperature sensor to estimate the user’s
skin temperature variation each night. Other Fitbit devices use other sensors
to measure the temperature in the user’s surrounding area. See [How can Fitbit
help me track my
temperature?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237207) for more

## Additional Information
### Device support
The Fitbit devices have the ability to set an alarm. Older devices whose
alarms are configured in the mobile application support the create, delete,
get and update alarm endpoints. Newer devices, listed in this help article
<https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226604>, contain an on-device
alarm application, and do not support the alarm endpoints. The alarms for
these devices can only be set on the device itself.
Setting an alarm without a recurring schedule is intended for next day
purposes only.

# Get VO2 Max Summary by Interval
This endpoint returns the Cardio Fitness Score (also know as VO2 Max) data for
a date range. VO2 Max values will be shown as a range if no run data is
available or a single numeric value if the user uses a GPS for runs. See
[Additional Information](/build/reference/web-api/cardio-fitness-score/get-
vo2max-summary-by-interval/#Additional-Information) for further context.
The endpoint response ignores the [Units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/application-design/#Units) header. The value returned is always in
ml/kg/min.

## Additional Information
### Displaying VO2 Max data
The cardio fitness score is calculated every time the person exercises. A
user’s cardio fitness score is determined by their resting heart rate, age,
gender, weight, and other personal information. The user’s cardio fitness
score will be shown as a range unless the user uses GPS for runs, in which
case it will be returned as a single numeric value. For more information, see
[What is My Cardio Score?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237924).
### Subscription Support for Cardio Fitness Score (VO2 Max)
VO2 Max does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since VO2 Max is
recorded during exercise, the activity notification arrival time can be used
to estimate when the V02 max data will be available. For more information, see
[Displaying V02 Max data](/build/reference/web-api/cardio-fitness-score/get-
vo2max-summary-by-date/#Displaying-VO2-Max-data). For applications that do not
track activity, or cannot retrieve activity data, we recommend querying the
V02 max data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available (e.g.
12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The VO2 Max endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. For more
information, see [Rate Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/application-design/#Rate-Limits).
### Device compatibility
VO2 Max data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support VO2 Max data collection. For more
information, see the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports VO2 Max.

## Output Indicator
Ensure that, except for the parts modified to follow the latest specifications, the structure and format of the code remain identical to the original code. Here, "identical" means that there should be no differences (diff) whatsoever, including in indentation, spaces, line breaks, and code structure, which should all be exactly the same as the original.
If there are any changes beyond the modified sections, this is considered incorrect.
Also, verify that the modified code conforms to the latest specifications.
