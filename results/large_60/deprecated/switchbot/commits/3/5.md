## Instruction
You are a software engineer specializing in REST APIs.
Please follow the guidelines below to make the necessary modifications.

### Modification Procedure
1. Analyze the deprecated specifications based on `## Deprecated specification`.
2. Based on the analysis in step 1., identify code snippets that follow deprecated specifications within the source code in `## Input Code`.
3. Modify the code snippets identified in step 2. to follow the latest specifications, while paying attention to the points listed in `### Attention` below.

### Attention
There may be multiple code snippets following deprecated specifications within `## Input Code`.
Do not perform refactoring or add comments; only modify the parts of the code that follow deprecated specifications to conform to the latest specifications.
Copy the source code from `## Input Code` before making modifications.
Delete all parts only according to the deprecated specification and modify the code to conform to the latest specification.
Only modify the parts of the code that follow deprecated specifications.
If no deprecated specification is found in the source code of the `## Input Code`, compare the source code with the latest specification to identify any differences. If modifications are required, modify the source code according to the latest specification.
Make sure to modify all code that follows deprecated specifications.
After modifications, ensure that all code following deprecated specifications has been replaced with code that conforms to the latest specifications.
If multiple deprecated specifications are present within `## Input Code`, confirm that all are unified under the latest specifications.

## Introduction
This document describes a collection of SwitchBot API methods, examples, and
best practices for, but not limited to, IoT hobbyists, developers, and gurus
to make their own smart home programs or applications.
## Getting Started
Please follow these steps,
  1. Download the SwitchBot app on App Store or Google Play Store
  2. Register a SwitchBot account and log in into your account
  3. Generate an Open Token within the app a) Go to Profile > Preference b) Tap App Version 10 times. Developer Options will show up c) Tap Developer Options d) Tap Get Token
  4. Roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty with SwitchBot OpenAPI!
## Authentication
### Open Token
The token returned from the SwitchBot Cloud is an encrypted open token that
grants the user developer-level permissions. The user will be able to add,
delete, edit, and look up his or her user data including profile data and data
associated with the devices that have been added to the user's account.

## API Usage
### Host Domain

    https://api.switch-bot.com

### Sending a Request
The following request types are supported,
  * GET
  * PUT
  * POST
  * DELETE
#### Content-Type
For `POST` requests, use `application/json; charset=utf8` as the `Content-
Type`
#### Request limit
The amount of API calls per day is limited to **10000** times. Going over that
limit will return "Unauthorized."
### Request Header
The following parameters need to be included into the header,
Parameter | Type | Location | Required | Description
---|---|---|---|---
Authorization | String | header | Yes | Open Token acquired
### Standard HTTP Error Codes
The following table lists the most common HTTP error response,
Code | Name | Description
---|---|---
400 | Bad Request | The client has issued an invalid request. This is commonly used to specify validation errors in a request payload.
401 | Unauthorized | Authorization for the API is required, but the request has not been authenticated.
403 | Forbidden | The request has been authenticated but does not have appropriate permissions, or a requested resource is not found.
404 | Not Found | Specifies the requested path does not exist.
406 | Not Acceptable | The client has requested a MIME type via the Accept header for a value not supported by the server.
415 | Unsupported Media Type | The client has defined a contentType header that is not supported by the server.
422 | Unprocessable Entity | The client has made a valid request, but the server cannot process it. This is often used for APIs for which certain limits have been exceeded.
429 | Too Many Requests | The client has exceeded the number of requests allowed for a given time window.
500 | Internal Server Error | An unexpected error on the SmartThings servers has occurred. These errors should be rare.
## Devices
The devices API is used to access the properties and states of SwitchBot
devices and to send control commands to those devices.
### Get device list

    GET /v1.0/devices
#### Description
Get a list of devices, which include physical devices and virtual infrared
remote devices that have been added to the current user's account.
Physical devices refer to the following SwitchBot products,
  * Hub
  * Hub Plus
  * Hub Mini
  * Bot (MUST enable Cloud Service first)
  * Curtain (MUST enable Cloud Service first)
  * Plug
  * Meter (MUST enable Cloud Service first)
  * Motion Sensor (MUST enable Cloud Service first)
  * Contact Sensor (MUST enable Cloud Service first)
  * Color Bulb
  * Humidifier
  * Smart Fan
  * Strip Light
  * Plug Mini (US)
  * Plug Mini (JP)
  * Lock
  * Meter Plus (JP) (MUST enable Cloud Service first)

  * `new` Robot Vacuum Cleaner S1
  * `new` Robot Vacuum Cleaner S1 Plus
Virtual infrared remote devices refer to virtual devices that are used to
simulate infrared signals of a home appliance remote control. A SwitchBot Hub
Plus / Hub Mini is required in order to be able to create these virtual
devices within the app.

## Output Indicator
Ensure that, except for the parts modified to follow the latest specifications, the structure and format of the code remain identical to the original code. Here, "identical" means that there should be no differences (diff) whatsoever, including in indentation, spaces, line breaks, and code structure, which should all be exactly the same as the original.
If there are any changes beyond the modified sections, this is considered incorrect.
Also, verify that the modified code conforms to the latest specifications.
