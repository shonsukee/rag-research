## Additional Information
### Types of sleep logs
This endpoint supports two kinds of sleep log types:
  1. stages : Levels data is returned with 30-second granularity. 'Sleep Stages' levels include deep, light, rem, and wake.
  2. classic : Levels data returned with 60-second granularity. 'Sleep Pattern' levels include asleep, restless, and awake.
> **Note:** shortData is only included for stages sleep logs and includes wake
> periods that are 3 minutes or less in duration. This distinction is to
> simplify graphically distinguishing short wakes from longer wakes, but they
> are physiologically equivalent.
For information on how to interpret the sleep data, see [Interpreting the
Sleep Stage and Short Data](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/best-
practices/#Interpreting-the-Sleep-Stage-and-Short-Data).
### Sleep Efficiency Calculation
The sleep log response will return a sleep efficiency score. Sleep efficiency
is supported for classic sleep logs, only. Even though a value may be returned
for both classic and stage sleep logs, the sleep efficiency value returned for
stages sleep logs should be ignored. Sleep efficiency for classic sleep logs
uses the standard calculation of

    sleep efficiency = minutesAsleep/timeInBed

> **Note:** The sleep efficiency score should not be confused with the sleep
> score returned by the mobile application, as they are calculated
> differently. Sleep score is not supported through the Web API.
### Device generated sleep logs
The `dateOfSleep` in the GET sleep log endpoint response is the date on which
the sleep event ends. This means that requesting a sleep log for a given date,
for example 2021-12-22, may return a log entry that began the previous night
on 2021-12-21. This is to account for the fact that sleep periods typically
take place overnight between two dates and the dateOfSleep refers to the date
the user woke up.
If the wake time during the main sleep is greater than 1 hour, the sleep log
will be split into 2 logs.
Although, if the device syncs during the wake time and consistent steps and
hand movement occur for at least 15 minutes, then a sleep log might be
generated for the first part of the sleep. The second part of the sleep will
be detected when the device syncs in the morning. If the time between the 2
sleep logs is less than 1 hour, the 2 sleep logs will be stitched together.
### Manually created Sleep Logs
A manual sleep log is either a sleep log that has human input through the
mobile or web application, or a 3rd party application records sleep using the
[Create Sleep Log](/build/reference/web-api/sleep/create-sleep-log/) endpoint.
When a sleep log is manually recorded, a "classic" sleep log is generated.
Sleep "stage" logs use the device heart rate and movement to calculate sleep
stage data. When manually entering a sleep log, this information is typically
not available.
It is **NOT** possible to create overlapping logs.
### "logType" values
This field returns information on whether the user’s sleep data was
automatically or manually detected. It includes the following 2 values:
  1. **auto_detected** : Sleep was automatically detected by our sleep detection service.
  2. **manual** : Sleep was logged by the user or edited by the user after being automatically detected.
### Meta response
Some of the sleep log processing occurs asynchronously. On rare occassions,
your application may be querying the sleep logs while the sleep data is still
being processed. If the sleep logs are still in a processing state, a "meta"
response will be returned. This response will indicate a retry duration given
in milliseconds. The "meta" response may evolve with additional fields in the
future; API clients should be prepared to ignore any new object properties
they do not recognize.
If the user has only 1 sleep log that is being processed, the response will
contain only the meta field.

    {
        "meta": {
            "retryDuration": 3000,
            "state": "pending"
        }
    }

However, if there is a second sleep log present for that day, then the sleep,
summary and meta fields will be returned.

    {
        "meta": {
            "retryDuration": 3000,
            "state": "pending"

### Sleep Efficiency Calculation
The sleep log response will return a sleep efficiency score. Sleep efficiency
is supported for classic sleep logs, only. Even though a value may be returned
for both classic and stage sleep logs, the sleep efficiency value returned for
stages sleep logs should be ignored. Sleep efficiency for classic sleep logs
uses the standard calculation of

    sleep efficiency = minutesAsleep/timeInBed

> differently. Sleep score is not supported through the Web API.
### Device generated sleep logs
The `dateOfSleep` in the GET sleep log endpoint response is the date on which
the sleep event ends. This means that requesting a sleep log for a given date,
for example 2021-12-22, may return a log entry that began the previous night
on 2021-12-21. This is to account for the fact that sleep periods typically
take place overnight between two dates and the dateOfSleep refers to the date
the user woke up.
If the wake time during the main sleep is greater than 1 hour, the sleep log
will be split into 2 logs.
Although, if the device syncs during the wake time and consistent steps and
hand movement occur for at least 15 minutes, then a sleep log might be
generated for the first part of the sleep. The second part of the sleep will
be detected when the device syncs in the morning. If the time between the 2
sleep logs is less than 1 hour, the 2 sleep logs will be stitched together.
### Manually created sleep logs
A manual sleep log is either a sleep log that has human input through the
mobile or web application, or a 3rd party application records sleep using the
[Create Sleep Log](/build/reference/web-api/sleep/create-sleep-log/) endpoint.
When a sleep log is manually recorded, a "classic" sleep log is generated.
Sleep "stage" logs use the device heart rate and movement to calculate sleep
stage data. When manually entering a sleep log, this information is typically
not available.
It is **NOT** possible to create overlapping logs.
### "logType" values
This field returns information on whether the user’s sleep data was
automatically or manually detected. It includes the following 2 values:
  1. **auto_detected** : Sleep was automatically detected by our sleep detection service.
  2. **manual** : Sleep was logged by the user or edited by the user after being automatically detected.
### Meta response
Some of the sleep log processing occurs asynchronously. On rare occassions,
your application may be querying the sleep logs while the sleep data is still
being processed. If the sleep logs are still in a processing state, a "meta"
response will be returned. This response will indicate a retry duration given
in milliseconds. The "meta" response may evolve with additional fields in the
future; API clients should be prepared to ignore any new object properties
they do not recognize.
If the user has only 1 sleep log that is being processed, the response will
contain only the meta field.

    {
        "meta": {
            "retryDuration": 3000,
            "state": "pending"
        }
    }

However, if there is a second sleep log present for that day, then the sleep,
summary and meta fields will be returned.

    {
        "meta": {
            "retryDuration": 3000,
            "state": "pending"

## Additional Information
### Types of sleep logs
This endpoint supports two kinds of sleep log types:
  1. stages : Levels data is returned with 30-second granularity. 'Sleep Stages' levels include deep, light, rem, and wake.
  2. classic : Levels data returned with 60-second granularity. 'Sleep Pattern' levels include asleep, restless, and awake.
> **Note:** shortData is only included for stages sleep logs and includes wake
> periods that are 3 minutes or less in duration. This distinction is to
> simplify graphically distinguishing short wakes from longer wakes, but they
> are physiologically equivalent.
For information on how to interpret the sleep data, see [Interpreting the
Sleep Stage and Short Data](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/best-
practices/#Interpreting-the-Sleep-Stage-and-Short-Data).
### Sleep Efficiency Calculation
The sleep log response will return a sleep efficiency score. Sleep efficiency
is supported for classic sleep logs, only. Even though a value may be returned
for both classic and stage sleep logs, the sleep efficiency value returned for
stages sleep logs should be ignored. Sleep efficiency for classic sleep logs
uses the standard calculation of

    sleep efficiency = minutesAsleep/timeInBed

> **Note:** The sleep efficiency score should not be confused with the sleep
> score returned by the mobile application, as they are calculated
> differently. Sleep score is not supported through the Web API.
### Device generated sleep logs
The `dateOfSleep` in the GET sleep log endpoint response is the date on which
the sleep event ends. This means that requesting a sleep log for a given date,
for example 2021-12-22, may return a log entry that began the previous night
on 2021-12-21. This is to account for the fact that sleep periods typically
take place overnight between two dates and the dateOfSleep refers to the date
the user woke up.
If the wake time during the main sleep is greater than 1 hour, the sleep log
will be split into 2 logs.
Although, if the device syncs during the wake time and consistent steps and
hand movement occur for at least 15 minutes, then a sleep log might be
generated for the first part of the sleep. The second part of the sleep will
be detected when the device syncs in the morning. If the time between the 2
sleep logs is less than 1 hour, the 2 sleep logs will be stitched together.
### Manually created Sleep Logs
A manual sleep log is either a sleep log that has human input through the
mobile or web application, or a 3rd party application records sleep using the
[Create Sleep Log](/build/reference/web-api/sleep/create-sleep-log/) endpoint.
When a sleep log is manually recorded, a "classic" sleep log is generated.
Sleep "stage" logs use the device heart rate and movement to calculate sleep
stage data. When manually entering a sleep log, this information is typically
not available.
It is **NOT** possible to create overlapping logs.
### "logType" values
This field returns information on whether the user’s sleep data was
automatically or manually detected. It includes the following 2 values:
  1. **auto_detected** : Sleep was automatically detected by our sleep detection service.
  2. **manual** : Sleep was logged by the user or edited by the user after being automatically detected.
### Meta response
Some of the sleep log processing occurs asynchronously. On rare occassions,
your application may be querying the sleep logs while the sleep data is still
being processed. If the sleep logs are still in a processing state, a "meta"
response will be returned. This response will indicate a retry duration given
in milliseconds. The "meta" response may evolve with additional fields in the
future; API clients should be prepared to ignore any new object properties
they do not recognize.
If the user has only 1 sleep log that is being processed, the response will
contain only the meta field.

    {
        "meta": {
            "retryDuration": 3000,
            "state": "pending"
        }
    }

However, if there is a second sleep log present for that day, then the sleep,
summary and meta fields will be returned.

    {
        "meta": {
            "retryDuration": 3000,
            "state": "pending"
        }

## Additional Information
It is **NOT** possible to create overlapping log entries. The `dateOfSleep` in
the response for the sleep log is the date on which the sleep event ends.
This endpoint supports two kinds of sleep data:
  1. stages : Levels data is returned with 30-second granularity. 'Sleep Stages' levels include deep, light, rem, and wake.
  2. classic : Levels data returned with 60-second granularity. 'Sleep Pattern' levels include asleep, restless, and awake.
> **Note:** shortData is only included for stages sleep logs and includes wake
> periods that are 3 minutes or less in duration. This distinction is to
> simplify graphically distinguishing short wakes from longer wakes, but they
> are physiologically equivalent.
### Manually Created Sleep Logs
A manual sleep log is either a sleep log that has human input through the
mobile or web application, or a 3rd party application records sleep using the
[Create Sleep Log](/build/reference/web-api/sleep/create-sleep-log/) endpoint.
When a sleep log is manually recorded, a "classic" sleep log is generated.
Sleep "stage" logs use the device heart rate and movement to calculate sleep
stage data. When manually entering a sleep log, this information is typically
not available.

# Get Sleep Log by Date Range
This endpoint returns a list of a user's sleep log entries for a date range.
The data returned for either date can include a sleep period that ended that
date but began on the previous date. For example, if you request a sleep log
between 2021-12-22 and 2021-12-26, it may return log entries that span
2021-12-21 and 2021-12-22, as well as 2021-12-25 and 2021-12-26.
It uses [units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-
design/#Unit-Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.

# Sleep Logs Version 1 (Deprecated)
## Overview
These endpoints are deprecated and support for them may end unexpectedly. If
your application does not depend on the sleep as calculated by these
endpoints, please use the new [v1.2 sleep endpoints](/build/reference/web-
api/sleep/).
> **Note** : Version 1 APIs **do not** support Sleep Stages data
## Get Sleep Logs by Date
The **Get Sleep Logs by Date** endpoint returns a summary and list of a user's
sleep log entries (including naps) as well as detailed sleep entry data for a
given day.
The relationship between sleep log entry properties is expressed with the
following equation:

     timeInBed = minutesToFallAsleep + minutesAsleep + minutesAwake +
     minutesAfterWakeup

#### Resource URL

    GET https://api.fitbit.com/1/user/[user-id]/sleep/date/[date].json

URL parameters:
**user-id** | The ID of the user. Use "-" (dash) for current logged-in user.
---|---
**date** | The date of records to be returned. In the format **yyyy-MM-dd**.
#### Example Request

    GET https://api.fitbit.com/1/user/-/sleep/date/2014-09-01.json

#### Example Response
**Note:** The text within the brackets `<>` is a descriptive placeholder for a
value or repeated elements. Also, values for **minuteData** can be **1**
("asleep"), **2** ("restless"), or **3** ("awake").

## Sleep Time Series (Deprecated)
**Note:** This API has been deprecated with the introduction of version 1.2 of
the Sleep APIs described above. Sleep Stages data cannot be retrieved with
this API. If your application requires data consistency while you transition
over to the version 1.2 Sleep APIs, you can get this data through the [version
1 Get Sleep Logs by Date endpoint](/build/reference/web-api/sleep-v1/#get-
sleep-logs-by-date).
The **Get Sleep Time Series** endpoint returns time series data in the
specified range for a given resource in the format requested using units in
the [unit system](/build/reference/web-api/basics#units) that corresponds to
the Accept-Language header provided.
**Note:** Even if you provide earlier dates in the request, the response
retrieves only data since the user's join date or the first log entry date for
the requested collection.
#### Resource URL
There are two acceptable formats for retrieving intraday data:

    GET https://api.fitbit.com/1/user/[user-id]/[resource-path]/date/[date]/[period].json

**api-version** | The API version. Currently version **1**.
---|---
**user-id** | The encoded ID of the user. Use "-" (dash) for current logged-in user.
**resource-path** | The resource path; see the **Resource Path Options** below for a list of options.
**date** | The end date of the period specified in the format **yyyy-MM-dd** or **today**.
**period** | The range for which data will be returned. Options are **1d, 7d, 30d, 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y,** or **max.**

    GET https://api.fitbit.com/1/user/[user-id]/[resource-path]/date/[base-date]/[end-date].json

**api-version** | The API version. Currently version **1**.
---|---
**user-id** | The encoded ID of the user. Use "-" (dash) for current logged-in user.
**resource-path** | The resource path; see the **Resource Path Options** below for a list of options.
**base-date** | The range start date, in the format **yyyy-MM-dd** or **today**.

## Additional Information
Using units in the unit system which corresponds to the Accept-Language header
provided.
### "logType" values
The source of the activity log can be determined by the _logType_ response
element.
  * `auto_detected` activity logs are those created by Fitbit’s SmartTrack feature.
  * `manual` activity logs are user specified overrides of some or all tracker data.
  * `mobile_run` activity logs are created after completing a MobileRun.
  * `tracker` activity logs are those created using the multisport exercise mode on a Fitbit device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### "offset" query parameter
The offset query parameter is not fully supported and it's future is unknown.
Therefore, the only supported value is 0. To paginate, request the next and
previous links in the pagination response object. Using the "offset" query
parameter in any other capacity could cause your application to break.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to

subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a

The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible

## Additional Information
The activity log entries for a given day are displayed in the format requested
using units in the unit system corresponding to the Accept-Language header
provided.
#### Privacy Setting
The Fitbit privacy setting Activities (“Friends Only” and “Public”) grants
access to a user's resource with the exception that the response DOES NOT
include a detailed list of activity log entries.
#### Considerations
  1. Daily summary data and daily goals for elevation (elevation, floors) only included for users with a device with an altimeter.
  2. The steps field in activity log entries included only for activities that have steps (e.g. "Walking", "Running"); distance only included when it is relevant.
  3. Calorie burn goal (caloriesOut) represents either dynamic daily target from the premium trainer plan or manual calorie burn goal. Goals are included in the response only for today and 21 days in the past.
### Retrieving heart rate data within the activity response
The Heart Rate Zones data array can be displayed within this endpoint's
response. For this to occur, the following are required. If any of the items
are missing, the data array will not be displayed.
  1. The _heartrate_ scope enabled by the user.
  2. A heart rate enabled device paired to the user's account.
  3. Heart rate data recorded by the device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.
### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

## Additional Information
This endpoint uses the units in the unit system which corresponds to the
Accept-Language header provided (or using optional custom distanceUnit) and
sends a JSON response in the format requested.
When specifying the **startTime** parameter value, do not include seconds.
Seconds is not a supported value and will return incorrect data when it is
included.
### Activity Types
Any activity log entry is based on one of the activities from the catalog of
activities. Though activities in catalog have a tree structure (i.e. divided
into categories like "Sports and Workouts", "Running" and subcategories like
"Bicycling", "Walking"), each activity leaf in the catalog can also have more
granular structure. Each leaf can have a directory activity type (and have
child intensity levels) or simple activity (have no levels). When creating a
new activity log entry, use the following types of objects to pass as the
activityId value:
  * **Directory activity id** : activity contains child activities which represents intensity levels (e.g. "Running").
  * **Intensity level id** : activity within directory activity (e.g. "Running/6.7mph (9 min/mile)").
  * **Simple activity id** : single activity without intensity levels (e.g. "Shoveling snow").
> **Note:** A list of activities can be retrieved via the Browse Activities
> endpoint.

### Custom Activities
In the process of creating a new activity log entry, it is possible to
seamlessly create a new custom activity for the user. This can be achieved by
using the second scenario for the set of POST parameters (providing
activityName instead of activityId). In this case, either existing custom
activity with the same name will be used for creating new log entry or a new
record created and then logged. As for custom activities on the website,
manualCalories must always provided with the activityName parameter among
other required fields.
> **Note:** "Steps" may be used as a distanceUnits value when the activity is
> either "Walking" (activityId=90013) or "Running" (activityId=90009) and
> distance is only included when it is relevant.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.

## Additional Information
You can read more about data accuracy in the **Clinical Study** section of the
[Fitbit ECG App Instructions for
Use](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14253977#samd).
Additional information about the Fitbit ECG app can be found in the help
article [What is the Fitbit ECG
app?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236718).
### Limit / Offset
ECG data is very large because of the waveforms. Because of this, we cannot
query and return large numbers of ECG results, and limit the number of results
to 10. The offset query parameter is not fully supported and it's future is
unknown. Therefore, the only supported value is 0. Using the "offset" query
parameter in any other capacity could cause your application to break.
To paginate, request the next and previous links in the pagination response
object. The next and previous link should include afterDate or beforeDate
parameters of the datetime for the last reading in each page.
### Collecting ECG data
Before taking your first reading, review the Heart Rhythm Assessment. The
Heart Rhythm Assessment is found in the Fitbit mobile application.
Instructions can be found in the section "How do I use the Fitbit ECG app?"
within the help article [What is the Fitbit ECG
app?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236718).

# Get SpO2 Intraday by Interval
This endpoint returns the SpO2 intraday data for a specified date range. SpO2
applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep”, which is the longest single
period of time asleep on a given date. Spo2 values are calculated on a
5-minute exponentially-moving average.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For example, if you
request SpO2 levels for 2021-12-22, it may include measurements that were
taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user fell asleep.
The data returned includes the percentage value of SpO2 in your bloodstream
and an accurate timestamp for that measurement. It also uses
[units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Unit-
Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.
**Scope:** _oxygen_saturation_

## Additional Information
Interval Intraday values reflect SpO2 measurement taken for periods of sleep
between two dates. For most users, intraday values will span multiple dates to
account for SpO2 levels on the date at which the summary was provided, and
SpO2 levels during the previous night’s sleep.
Keep in mind, the intraday intervals have a maximum date range of 30 days.
Entering a date range that exceeds 30 days will return a 400 Bad Request
response code.
### Collecting SpO2 data
SpO2 data is collected when the user is in an extended period of sleep. There
are many factors that can affect a user’s SpO2 value. Recording the data while
a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect SpO2 data. An extended sleep period is considered to be at least 3
hours of quality sleep. In addition, data is only processed when the user is
still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can
prevent SpO2 data from processing. See help article [How do I track blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2) with my Fitbit
device?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226120) for more
information on SpO2 data processing on the Fitbit device.
The device stops collecting SpO2 data after it determines the user is awake,
typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their device, we
will begin processing the SpO2 data for that sleep period. It can take up to 1
hour for the SpO2 data to be processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for SpO2
SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection.

### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

# Get SpO2 Summary by Interval
This endpoint returns the SpO2 summary data for a specified date range. SpO2
applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep”, which is the longest single
period of time asleep on a given date.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For example, if you
request SpO2 levels for 2021-12-22, it may include measurements that were
taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user fell asleep.
The data returned includes average, minimum, and maximum SpO2 levels. It uses
[units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Unit-
Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.
**Scope:** _oxygen_saturation_

## Additional Information
The Interval Summary values reflect SpO2 measurements taken for sleep periods
between two dates. For most users, interval summaries may span multiple dates
to account for SpO2 levels on the date at which the summary was provided, and
SpO2 levels during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting SpO2 data
SpO2 data is collected when the user is in an extended period of sleep. There
are many factors that can affect a user’s SpO2 value. Recording the data while
a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect SpO2 data. An extended sleep period is considered to be at least 3
hours of quality sleep. In addition, data is only processed when the user is
still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can
prevent SpO2 data from processing. See help article [How do I track blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2) with my Fitbit
device?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226120) for more
information on SpO2 data processing on the Fitbit device.
The device stops collecting SpO2 data after it determines the user is awake,
typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their device, we
will begin processing the SpO2 data for that sleep period. It can take up to 1
hour for the SpO2 data to be processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for SpO2
SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
The value returned does not apply to a single date, necessarily, but to a
measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users, this will span two
dates to account for Temperature (Skin) values on the date at which the
summary was provided, as well as during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting Temperature (Skin) data
Temperature (Skin) data is collected when the user is in an extended period of
sleep of at least 3 hours.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s Temperature (Skin) value.
Recording the data while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to
correctly and accurately collect Temperature (Skin) data. Data is only
processed when the user is still. If a user moves too much or their sleep
session is too short, this can prevent Temperature (Skin) data from being
processed correctly. In addition, if recorded data is incapable of computing
specific sleep stages for a period of sleep, this will compromise the user’s
ability to retrieve a Temperature (Skin) value.
The device automatically stops collecting Temperature (Skin) data after it
determines the user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the
user syncs their device, Temperature (Skin) data will begin processing for
that sleep period. It usually takes up to 15 minutes for the data to be
processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for Temperature (Skin)
Temperature (Skin) does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since
Temperature (Skin) is recorded during periods of sleep, the sleep notification
arrival time can be used to estimate when the Temperature (Skin) data will be
available (See the "[Collecting Data](/build/reference/web-
api/temperature/get-temperature-skin-summary-by-interval/#Collecting-
Temperature-Skin-data)" section). For applications that do not track sleep, or
cannot retrieve sleep data, we recommend querying the Temperature (Skin) data
once or twice a day to determine if new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and
midnight). However, the frequency or rate at which you query Temperature
(Skin) data should be based on your specific use cases and with this in mind.
### Rate limit
The Temperature (Skin) endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See
[Rate Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-
design/#Rate-Limits).
### Device compatibility
Temperature (Skin) data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This
gives the user secure and transparent control over their data. The data is
then processed and made available through the API after the user syncs their
device with the Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support Temperature (Skin) data collection.
See the [Fitbit Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to
determine if your specific device supports Temperature (Skin).
#### Temperature Sensors
Some Fitbit devices use a dedicated temperature sensor to estimate the user’s
skin temperature variation each night. Other Fitbit devices use other sensors
to measure the temperature in the user’s surrounding area. See [How can Fitbit
help me track my
temperature?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237207) for more
information.

# Get SpO2 Intraday by Date
This endpoint returns the SpO2 intraday data for a single date. SpO2 applies
specifically to a user’s “main sleep”, which is the longest single period of
time asleep on a given date. Spo2 values are calculated on a 5-minute
exponentially-moving average.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For example, if you
request SpO2 levels for 2021-12-22, it may include measurements that were
taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user fell asleep.
The data returned includes the percentage value of SpO2 in your bloodstream
and an accurate timestamp for that measurement. It also uses
[units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Unit-
Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.

## Additional Information
Intraday values reflect SpO2 measurement taken for a period of sleep. For most
users, intraday values will span multiple dates to account for SpO2 levels on
the date at which the summary was provided, and SpO2 levels during the
previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting SpO2 data
SpO2 data is collected when the user is in an extended period of sleep. There
are many factors that can affect a user’s SpO2 value. Recording the data while
a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect SpO2 data. An extended sleep period is considered to be at least 3
hours of quality sleep. In addition, data is only processed when the user is
still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can
prevent SpO2 data from processing. See help article [How do I track blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2) with my Fitbit
device?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226120) for more
information on SpO2 data processing on the Fitbit device.
The device stops collecting SpO2 data after it determines the user is awake,
typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their device, we
will begin processing the SpO2 data for that sleep period. It can take up to 1
hour for the SpO2 data to be processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for SpO2
SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user

Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

## Additional Information
The response if provided in the format requested using units in the unit
system which corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
A recent activity record contains the distance and duration values recorded
during the last time the activity was logged. The record retrieved can be used
to log the activity via the Log Activity endpoint with the same or adjusted
values for distance and duration.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.

## Additional Information
The activity log entries for a given day are displayed in the format requested
using units in the unit system corresponding to the Accept-Language header
provided.
#### Considerations
  * User data is only available since the user's join date or the first log entry date for the requested collection.
  * The tracker/... resource represents the daily activity values logged by the tracker device only, excluding manual activity log entires.
  * The tracker/calories resource does not include the Estimated Energy Requirement for calories estimation (EER) calculations for any dates even if they are turned on for the user's profile and use BMR level instead.
  * Elevation time series (/elevation, /floors) are only available for users with compatible trackers.
  * The activities collection are maintained for backwards compatible resource URLs (e.g. (activities/log/calories)).

**Calorie Time Series Differences**
  * **calories** \- The top level time series for calories burned inclusive of BMR, tracked activity, and manually logged activities.
  * **caloriesBMR** \- Value includes only [BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) calories.
  * **activityCalories** \- The number of calories burned during the day for periods of time when the user was active above sedentary level. This value is calculated minute by minute for minutes that fall within this criteria. This includes activity burned calories and BMR.
  * **tracker/calories** \- Calories burned inclusive of BMR according to movement captured by a Fitbit tracker.
  * **tracker/activityCalories** \- Calculated similarly to _activityCalories_ , but uses only tracker data. Manually logged activities are excluded.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).

# Get Breathing Rate Intraday by Date
This endpoint returns intraday breathing rate data for a specified date. It
measures the average breathing rate throughout the day and categories your
breathing rate by sleep stage. Sleep stages vary between light sleep, deep
sleep, REM sleep, and full sleep.
The single date measurements are provided at the end of a period of sleep. The
data returned can and often does reflect a sleep period that began the day
before. For example, if you request a daily breathing rate for 2021-12-22, it
may include measurements that were taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when
the user started to sleep.

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
The value returned does not apply to a single date, necessarily, but to a
measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users, this will span two
dates to account for breathing rates on the date at which the summary was
provided, as well as during the previous night’s sleep.
### Sleep Stages
Intraday breathing rate data is categorized by sleep stage. This gives users a
sense of how their average breathing rate differs depending on the type of
sleep they were in during a sleep cycle. In cases where a sleep period value
could not be calculated due to lack of data, a "-1.0" will be returned.
Click [here](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236712) to learn more
about the light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep stages.
### Collecting breathing rate data
Breathing rate data is collected when the user is in an extended period of
sleep of at least 3 hours.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s breathing rate value.
Recording the data while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to
correctly and accurately collect breathing rate data. Data is only processed
when the user is still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too
short, this can prevent breathing rate data from being processed correctly. In
addition, if recorded data is incapable of computing specific sleep stages for
a period of sleep, this will compromise the user’s ability to retrieve a
breathing rate value.
The device automatically stops collecting breathing rate data after it
determines the user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the
user syncs their device, breathing rate data will begin processing for that
sleep period. It usually takes up to 15 minutes for the breathing rate data to
be processed and made available to download.
You can read more about **data accuracy** on
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00493-6>
### Subscription Support for Breathing Rate
Breathing Rate does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since
Breathing Rate is recorded during periods of sleep, the sleep notification
arrival time can be used to estimate when the Breathing Rate data will be
available (See the "Collecting Data" section). For applications that do not
track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep data, we recommend querying the
Breathing Rate data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The breathing rate endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
Breathing rate data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives
the user secure and transparent control over their data. The data is
thenprocessed and made available through the API after the user syncs their
device with the Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support breathing rate data collection. See
the [Fitbit Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to
determine if your specific device supports breathing rate.

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
The value returned does not apply to a single date, necessarily, but to a
measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users, this will span two
dates to account for the HRV values on the date at which the summary was
provided, as well as during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting HRV data
HRV data is collected when the following conditions have been met:
  * the Health Metrics tile in the user's mobile application dashboard is enabled.
  * the data is only collected when the user is sleeping.
  * the user must have a minimum of 3 hours of sleep.
  * during the main sleep period, a sleep stages log is created.
If any of these items do not occur, then HRV data will not be collected.
For HRV, a HTTP status 200 means the endpoint executed successfully regardless
if data exists. A premium subscription is not needed for the Health Metrics
tile or HRV data collection.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s HRV value. Recording the data
while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect HRV data. Data is only processed when the user is still. If a user
moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can prevent HRV data
from being processed correctly. In addition, if recorded data is incapable of
computing specific sleep stages for a period of sleep, this will compromise
the user’s ability to retrieve an HRV value.
The device automatically stops collecting HRV data after it determines the
user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their
device, HRV data will begin processing for that sleep period. It usually takes
up to 15 minutes for the HRV data to be processed and made available to
download.
You can read more about **data accuracy** on
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00493-6>
### Subscription Support for HRV
HRV does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since HRV is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the HRV data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the HRV data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The HRV endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
HRV data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support HRV data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports HRV.

# Get Breathing Rate Summary by Interval
This endpoint returns average breathing rate data for a date range. Breathing
Rate data applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep,” which is the longest
single period of time during which they were asleep on a given date.
The single date measurements are provided at the end of a period of sleep. The
data returned can and often does reflect a sleep period that began the day
before. For example, if you request a daily breathing rate for 2021-12-22, it
may include measurements that were taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when
the user started to sleep.

# Get HRV Intraday by Interval
This endpoint returns the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) intraday data for a
date range. HRV data applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep,” which is
the longest single period of time asleep on a given date. It measures your HRV
rate at various times and returns Root Mean Square of Successive Differences
(rmssd), Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF), and Coverage data for a
given measurement. Rmssd measures short-term variability in your heart rate
while asleep. LF and HF capture the power in interbeat interval fluctuations
within either high frequency or low frequency bands. Finally, coverage refers
to data completeness in terms of the number of interbeat intervals.
Single date measurements are provided at the end of a period of sleep. The
data returned can and often does reflects a sleep period that began the day
before. For example, if you request a daily HRV rate for 2021-12-22, it may
include measurements that were taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the
user fell asleep.
It uses [units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
Interval values reflect breathing rate measurements taken for periods of sleep
between two dates. For most users, values will span multiple dates to account
for breathing rates on the date at which the summary was provided, and during
the previous night’s sleep.
### Sleep Stages
Intraday breathing rate data is categorized by sleep stage. This gives users a
sense of how their average breathing rate differs depending on the type of
sleep they were in during a sleep cycle. In cases where a sleep period value
could not be calculated due to lack of data, a "-1.0" will be returned.
Click [here](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236712) to learn more
about the light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep stages.
### Collecting breathing rate data
Breathing rate data is collected when the user is in an extended period of
sleep of at least 3 hours.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s breathing rate value.
Recording the data while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to
correctly and accurately collect breathing rate data. Data is only processed
when the user is still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too
short, this can prevent breathing rate data from being processed correctly. In
addition, if recorded data is incapable of computing specific sleep stages for
a period of sleep, this will compromise the user’s ability to retrieve a
breathing rate value.
The device automatically stops collecting breathing rate data after it
determines the user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the
user syncs their device, breathing rate data will begin processing for that
sleep period. It usually takes up to 15 minutes for the breathing rate data to
be processed and made available to download.
You can read more about **data accuracy** on
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00493-6>
### Subscription Support for Breathing Rate
Breathing Rate does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since
Breathing Rate is recorded during periods of sleep, the sleep notification
arrival time can be used to estimate when the Breathing Rate data will be
available (See the "Collecting Data" section). For applications that do not
track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep data, we recommend querying the
Breathing Rate data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The breathing rate endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
Breathing rate data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives
the user secure and transparent control over their data. The data is
thenprocessed and made available through the API after the user syncs their
device with the Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support breathing rate data collection. See
the [Fitbit Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to
determine if your specific device supports breathing rate.

# Get HRV Intraday by Date
This endpoint returns the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) intraday data for a
single date. HRV data applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep,” which is
the longest single period of time asleep on a given date. It measures the HRV
rate at various times and returns Root Mean Square of Successive Differences
(rmssd), Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF), and Coverage data for a
given measurement. Rmssd measures short-term variability in your heart rate
while asleep. LF and HF capture the power in interbeat interval fluctuations
within either high frequency or low frequency bands. Finally, coverage refers
to data completeness in terms of the number of interbeat intervals.
Single date measurements are provided at the end of a period of sleep. The
data returned usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For
example, if you request a daily HRV rate for 2021-12-22, it may include
measurements that were taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user
fell asleep.
It uses [units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-
design/#Unit-Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
The value returned does not apply to a single date, necessarily, but to a
measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users, this will span two
dates to account for the HRV values on the date at which the summary was
provided, as well as during the previous night’s sleep.
### Intraday data response frequency
HRV response data is returned every 5 minutes. This applies exclusively to
intraday endpoints.
### Collecting HRV data
HRV data is collected when the following conditions have been met:
  * the Health Metrics tile in the user's mobile application dashboard is enabled.
  * the data is only collected when the user is sleeping.
  * the user must have a minimum of 3 hours of sleep.
  * during the main sleep period, a sleep stages log is created.
If any of these items do not occur, then HRV data will not be collected.
For HRV, a HTTP status 200 means the endpoint executed successfully regardless
if data exists. A premium subscription is not needed for the Health Metrics
tile or HRV data collection.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s HRV value. Recording the data
while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect HRV data. Data is only processed when the user is still. If a user
moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can prevent HRV data
from being processed correctly. In addition, if recorded data is incapable of
computing specific sleep stages for a period of sleep, this will compromise
the user’s ability to retrieve an HRV value.
The device automatically stops collecting HRV data after it determines the
user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their
device, HRV data will begin processing for that sleep period. It usually takes
up to 15 minutes for the HRV data to be processed and made available to
download.

## Additional Information
The response uses the measurement units as defined in the unit system, which
corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
#### Considerations
  * Only the current goals are returned.
  * Floors goal only returned for users who currently or have previously paired a Fitbit device with an altimeter.
  * Calories out goal represents either dynamic daily target from the Premium trainer plan or manual calorie burn goal.
The default daily goal values are:
  * 10 floors;
  * 30 active minutes; and
  * Calories out is user specific, which accounts for BMR.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.

# Get HRV Summary by Date
This endpoint returns the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data for a single date.
HRV data applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep,” which is the longest
single period of time asleep on a given date.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For example, if you
request a daily HRV rate for 2021-12-22, it may include measurements that were
taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user fell asleep.
It uses [units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
The value returned does not apply to a single date, necessarily, but to a
measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users, this will span two
dates to account for the HRV values on the date at which the summary was
provided, as well as during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting HRV data
HRV data is collected when the following conditions have been met:
  * the Health Metrics tile in the user's mobile application dashboard is enabled.
  * the data is only collected when the user is sleeping.
  * the user must have a minimum of 3 hours of sleep.
  * during the main sleep period, a sleep stages log is created.
If any of these items do not occur, then HRV data will not be collected.
For HRV, a HTTP status 200 means the endpoint executed successfully regardless
if data exists. A premium subscription is not needed for the Health Metrics
tile or HRV data collection.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s HRV value. Recording the data
while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect HRV data. Data is only processed when the user is still. If a user
moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can prevent HRV data
from being processed correctly. In addition, if recorded data is incapable of
computing specific sleep stages for a period of sleep, this will compromise
the user’s ability to retrieve an HRV value.
The device automatically stops collecting HRV data after it determines the
user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their
device, HRV data will begin processing for that sleep period. It usually takes
up to 15 minutes for the HRV data to be processed and made available to
download.
You can read more about **data accuracy** on
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00493-6>
### Subscription Support for HRV
HRV does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since HRV is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the HRV data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the HRV data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The HRV endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
HRV data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support HRV data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports HRV.

For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

## Additional Information
The activity log entries for a given day are displayed in the format requested
using units in the unit system corresponding to the Accept-Language header
provided.
#### Considerations
  * User data is only available since the user's join date or the first log entry date for the requested collection.
  * The tracker/... resource represents the daily activity values logged by the tracker device only, excluding manual activity log entires.
  * The tracker/calories resource does not include the Estimated Energy Requirement for calories estimation (EER) calculations for any dates even if they are turned on for the user's profile and use BMR level instead.
  * Elevation time series (/elevation, /floors) are only available for users with compatible trackers.
  * The activities collection are maintained for backwards compatible resource URLs (e.g. (activities/log/calories)).
### Resource Options
All Activity | Tracker Only Activity | Maximum Date Range
---|---|---
activityCalories | tracker/activityCalories | 30 days

**Calorie Time Series Differences**
  * **calories** \- The top level time series for calories burned inclusive of BMR, tracked activity, and manually logged activities.
  * **caloriesBMR** \- Value includes only [BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) calories.
  * **activityCalories** \- The number of calories burned during the day for periods of time when the user was active above sedentary level. This value is calculated minute by minute for minutes that fall within this criteria. This includes activity burned calories and BMR.
  * **tracker/calories** \- Calories burned inclusive of BMR according to movement captured by a Fitbit tracker.
  * **tracker/activityCalories** \- Calculated similarly to _activityCalories_ , but uses only tracker data. Manually logged activities are excluded.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.

# Get Breathing Rate Summary by Date
This endpoint returns average breathing rate data for a single date. Breathing
Rate data applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep,” which is the longest
single period of time during which they were asleep on a given date.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
can and often does reflect a sleep period that began the day before. For
example, if you request a daily breathing rate for 2021-12-22, it may include
measurements that were taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user
started to sleep.
It uses [units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-

## Additional Information
### Sleep periods
The value returned does not apply to a single date, necessarily, but to a
measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users, this will span two
dates to account for breathing rates on the date at which the summary was
provided, as well as during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting breathing rate data
Breathing rate data is collected when the user is in an extended period of
sleep of at least 3 hours.
There are many factors that can affect a user’s breathing rate value.
Recording the data while a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to
correctly and accurately collect breathing rate data. Data is only processed
when the user is still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too
short, this can prevent breathing rate data from being processed correctly. In
addition, if recorded data is incapable of computing specific sleep stages for
a period of sleep, this will compromise the user’s ability to retrieve a
breathing rate value.
The device automatically stops collecting breathing rate data after it
determines the user is awake, typically through physical movements. Once the
user syncs their device, breathing rate data will begin processing for that
sleep period. It usually takes up to 15 minutes for the breathing rate data to
be processed and made available to download.
You can read more about **data accuracy** on
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00493-6>
### Subscription Support for Breathing Rate
Breathing Rate does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since
Breathing Rate is recorded during periods of sleep, the sleep notification
arrival time can be used to estimate when the Breathing Rate data will be
available (See the "Collecting Data" section). For applications that do not
track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep data, we recommend querying the
Breathing Rate data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The breathing rate endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
Breathing rate data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives
the user secure and transparent control over their data. The data is
thenprocessed and made available through the API after the user syncs their
device with the Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support breathing rate data collection. See
the [Fitbit Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to
determine if your specific device supports breathing rate.

## Additional Information
### Alert Filtering
We will only reveal AFib alerts that have been opened by the user in the
Fitbit app. See [How do Fitbit Irregular Rhythm Notifications check for atrial
fibrillation
(AFib)?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236719?hl=en&sjid=16520403461986358893-NA)
It is important that the user is first aware of this notification and
understands its importance to their health. The app explains to the user what
an IRN is and that the notification is not a diagnosis. Once the user
interacts with the notification, the information is shared via API.
### Limit / Offset
The IRN data set is very large. Because of this, we cannot query and return
large numbers of IRN results, and limit the number of results to 10. The
offset query parameter is not fully supported and its future is unknown.
Therefore, the only supported value is 0. Using the "offset" query parameter
in any other capacity could cause your application to break.
To paginate, request the next and previous links in the pagination response
object. The next and previous link should include afterDate or beforeDate
parameters of the datetime for the last reading in each page.
### Subscription Support for IRN
IRN does not support subscription notifications (webhooks). We recommend
querying IRN data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight).

## Additional Information
#### Access Levels
There are 2 access level types for food log entries that an authorized user
can view via API requests. Each food is annotated with an **accessLevel**
field with one of the following values:
  * PUBLIC - Foods that are in Fitbit's public food database and are visible to any Fitbit users. Only Fitbit populates this database to avoid **spam** and **duplicate entries**.
  * PRIVATE - Foods created by a user either on the website or via the [Create Food](/build/reference/web-api/nutrition/create-food/) endpoint.
#### Considerations
  1. The units field contains references to respective Food Units.
  2. The accessLevel field can be PUBLIC or PRIVATE. Sharing custom foods is not supported.
  3. The mealTypeId field is always 7 (Anytime). Meals are not associated with particular times.

[similarity: 0.31638521]
Off-wrist data is defined as data
collected while the device is not worn. For example, step data can be
collected if the device was in a bag while driving down a bumpy road. By
design, daily summary totals include on-wrist totals and off-wrist totals;
while Intraday totals include on-wrist totals only.
#### Considerations
  1. If a user hasn't synced a tracker for more than seven (7) days, the tracker stores only summary values for the days older than one week. In this case, the intraday data for steps is zero and the intraday calories are calculated from BMR or EER. Intraday steps could be estimated from the total daily summary data by the equation above.
  2. For the current day we will include only values until current timestamp (in the user's timezone).
  3. If a specific time interval was passed to the call via **start-time/end-time** parameters, **data-value** will include a summary only for the requested time period (versus whole day).
  4. For the **activities/log/calories** resource, each data point also includes the **level** field that reflects calculated activity level for that time period **( 0 - sedentary; 1 - lightly active; 2 - fairly active; 3 - very active)**.
  5. If BMR or EER have been used to estimate calories for the whole specific day (no tracker data), intraday data for calories would be flat and estimated according to the simple equation **calories_1m = BMR(EER)/24/60.**
#### Using BMR/EER Algorithms
If a user had no Fitbit tracker data for the specific day then the greater of
Logged Activities + BMR (for minutes when there is no activity) and the
calories calculated from the EER for that day (if EER enabled for this user's
profile) are taken. In case, there was some data from the tracker for the
specific day, that data where available is used and for time where data is
unavailable, the BMR is used. If the total is less than 20% greater than BMR
then the EER (cals < EER * 0.8) is used. EER never used to calculate calories
for today.
#### Using BMR Formula
Fitbit uses the standard MD Mifflin-St Jeor equation:

    9.99 * weightKg + 6.25*heightCm - 4.92*ageYears + s, where s is +5 for
    males and -161 for female
#### EER Formula (TEE total energy expenditure)
The EER Formula is based on
<http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2006/oct/pdf/06_0034.pdf>, which in turn is
based on "Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary reference intakes for energy,
carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids
(macronutrients). Washington (DC): National Academy Press; 2005."
[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309085373&page=204](http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309085373&page=204)
#### MALE-based EER Formula:

    TEE = 864 - 9.72 x age (years) + 1.0 x (14.2 x weight(kg) + 503 x height
    (meters))
#### FEMALE-based EER Formula:

    TEE = 387 - 7.31 x age (years) + 1.0 x (10.9 x weight(kg) + 660.7 x height
    (meters))
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.
