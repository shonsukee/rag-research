# Client Credentials Grant Flow
The /oauth2/token endpoint can do the following:
  * Exchange the authorization code for the initial access token and refresh token (See [OAuth2 Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/oauth2-token)).
This process is required when using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE].
  * Obtain a new access token and refresh token when the existing access token has expired (See [Refresh Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/refresh-token/)).
  * Initiate the Client Credentials authorization flow (See [Client Credentials](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/client-credentials/)).
Fitbit follows the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow as specified in [RFC
6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4). This
authorization flow is used with specific Fitbit API endpoints related to
business operations. It is not supported by the public Web APIs to retrieve
Fitbit user data.
The Client Credentials Grant flow has the following steps:
  1. The application sends a request to https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token with its client_id and client_secret; and
  2. Fitbit authenticates your application and issues an access token.

# Authorize
Initiates the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow by presenting the consent screen to
the Fitbit user.
* * *
## Request
URL |  https://www.fitbit.com/oauth2/authorize
---|---
**Query Parameters** **client_id**
_required_ | This is the Fitbit API application id created within [dev.fitbit.com](https://dev.fitbit.com/apps). **Type:** string
---|---
**response_type**
_required_ | `code` for Authorization Code Grant Flow [with PKCE]
`token` for Implicit Grant Flow. **Type:** string
**scope**
_required_ | A space-delimited list of the permissions you are requesting. See [Scopes](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Scopes). **Type:** string
**redirect_uri**
_recommended_ | Where Fitbit should send the user after the user grants or denies consent. Required unless only one redirect URI is specified for the application in the settings on [dev.fitbit.com](https://dev.fitbit.com/apps). See [Redirect URIs](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Redirect-URL). **Type:** URI
**expires_in**
_optional_ | For use with the _Implicit Grant Flow_ only. Pre-select the desired access token lifetime. Authorization Code Grant flow [with PKCE] access tokens only support a lifetime of 8 hours (e.g. 28800). `86400` for 1 day
`604800` for 1 week
`2592000` for 30 days
`31536000` for 1 year **Default:** 86400 **Type:** string
**prompt**
_optional_ | Specify if you need to force the Fitbit authentication or the OAuth 2.0 authorization page to be displayed. When used, the `redirect_uri` parameter must be specified. `none` for default behavior.
`consent` to require consent from the user, even if they have previously
authorized your application.
`login` to require the user to sign in, but request consent according to the
default behavior.
`login consent` to require the user to sign in and authorize your application.
The space in this parameter value needs to be URL encoded. **Type:** string
**state**
_recommended_ | Provides any state that might be useful to your application when the user is redirected back to your application. This parameter will be added to the redirect URI exactly as your application specifies. Fitbit strongly recommend including an anti-forgery token in this parameter and confirming its value in the redirect to mitigate against cross-site request forgery (CSRF). **Type:** string
**code_challenge**
(For use with PKCE only)
_optional / required_ | The code challenge is derived from the code verifier by using a transformation on the code verifier. The code verifier is a cryptographically random string dynamically created for each authorization request. The available transformations are `S256 ` and `plain`. `S256`: must be used if supported by the client:
_code_challenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))_.
`plain`: does not mitigate as wide a range of attacks as `S256` and may be
used only if the client cannot technically support `S256`: _code_challenge =
code_verifier_. **Default:** plain **Type:** string
**code_challenge_method**
(For use with PKCE only)
_optional_ | Code verifier transformation method is `S256` or `plain`. **Default:** plain **Type:** string

## Additional Information
### Localizing the consent page
The Fitbit consent page supports localization. Since it is just a web form,
the text is translated based on the user's "Language by Region/Country"
setting in their Fitbit account. The user's device or browser language
settings may translate the consent language, as well. We do not support a
query parameter that forces language conversion.

## Additional Information
### JSON Web Tokens
Fitbit API access tokens use the JSON Web Token (JWT) format. Fitbit reserves
the right to change the contents and format of these tokens at any time.
Client applications should not create dependencies upon the token format.
Access tokens and refresh tokens may be up to 1,024 bytes in size.
### Web Browser Compatibility
The Fitbit API and its implementation of OAuth 2.0 are designed to work with
the current and one previous version of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft
Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. When a new version of a web browser is released,
Fitbit begins supporting that version and stop supporting the third most
recent version.

## Additional Information
An access token intentionally is short lived. This is an important security
mechanism of OAuth 2.0. When using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE]. By default, the access tokens have an eight-hour lifetime.
When an access token expires, an HTTP 401 error will be returned.
At this point, your application needs to refresh the access token. The Fitbit
API follows
[RFC6749](https<nolink>://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-6)
specification for refreshing access tokens. A refresh token does not expire
until it is used. The refresh token can only be used once, as a new refresh
token is returned with the new access token.
If the application makes identical refresh token requests within a two-minute
period, the Fitbit Web API will return the same response. This is to assist
applications unable to coordinate the refresh token flow between processes.
Alternatively, your application could redirect the user to the authentication
flow. If the user is signed in and the scopes requested match the previously
granted scopes, the user will be redirected to your redirect URL with a new
access token without being prompted.

# Revoke Token
Used to disable a user's authorization for an application. The revoke
endpoint, specifying either the access token or refresh token, will remove the
user's authorizations and all associated tokens. This endpoint conforms to
[RFC 7009](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009).
Revoking the access token or refresh token will provide the same result. When
the token is revoked, all tokens are revoked for that user. If an application
has multiple sessions (web, mobile, etc.) for the same user, the revocation
will remove all sessions (web, mobile, etc.) associated with that user.
In addition, a revocation request can be made for tokens used by public
clients. The Authorization header is not used. Instead, the public client's
client_id and associated token will need to be specified as parameters in the
revocation request.

## Additional Information
### Revoked tokens
Users have granular control over read/write access to their data through the
Fitbit Web API. When a user revokes consent to your application, their access
token becomes invalid and your access to that user's data through the Web API
is no longer available. What you do with the data that has already been
collected should be clearly documented in your Terms of Service and Privacy
Policy. Any guidelines or requirements defined by Fitbit will be specified in
our [Platform Terms of Service](https://dev.fitbit.com/legal/platform-terms-
of-service/).
### Revoking refresh tokens
When a `/oauth2/revoke` request is made with a refresh_token that is not
present in our database, the service will respond with an HTTP status code of
404 (NOT_FOUND). This signifies that the client can safely remove the
corresponding refresh_token from their own storage, as it is no longer valid
on the server-side. This provides clients with a clear indication to the
status of their refresh tokens, enabling them to maintain accurate and
efficient token management practices.

### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

## Additional Information
Knowing when a Fitbit device last synced with the Fitbit server is useful when
diagnosing reports that the Fitbit app is showing different values from what
the Fitbit Web API returns. Fitbit's own apps use the same Web API available
to third-party developers. However, when an active Bluetooth connection is
available, Fitbit's apps will show the summary values displayed on the device.
Often, this data has not yet synced with Fitbit's servers.
Third-party applications can check when a Fitbit device last synced with
Fitbit's servers using this endpoint.
For information on supporting users who have multiple devices paired with
their account, see [Multi-Device Overview](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/best-practices/#Multi-Device-Overview).

3. Heart rate data recorded by the device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.

subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using

is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.
### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

## Additional Information
Using units in the unit system which corresponds to the Accept-Language header
provided.
### "logType" values
The source of the activity log can be determined by the _logType_ response
element.
  * `auto_detected` activity logs are those created by Fitbit’s SmartTrack feature.
  * `manual` activity logs are user specified overrides of some or all tracker data.
  * `mobile_run` activity logs are created after completing a MobileRun.
  * `tracker` activity logs are those created using the multisport exercise mode on a Fitbit device.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### "offset" query parameter
The offset query parameter is not fully supported and it's future is unknown.
Therefore, the only supported value is 0. To paginate, request the next and
previous links in the pagination response object. Using the "offset" query
parameter in any other capacity could cause your application to break.
### Webhook notifications

The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the

4. For the **activities/log/calories** resource, each data point also includes the **level** field that reflects calculated activity level for that time period **( 0 - sedentary; 1 - lightly active; 2 - fairly active; 3 - very active)**.
  5. If BMR or EER have been used to estimate calories for the whole specific day (no tracker data), intraday data for calories would be flat and estimated according to the simple equation **calories_1m = BMR(EER)/24/60.**
#### Using BMR/EER Algorithms
If a user had no Fitbit tracker data for the specific day then the greater of
Logged Activities + BMR (for minutes when there is no activity) and the
calories calculated from the EER for that day (if EER enabled for this user's
profile) are taken. In case, there was some data from the tracker for the
specific day, that data where available is used and for time where data is
unavailable, the BMR is used. If the total is less than 20% greater than BMR
then the EER (cals < EER * 0.8) is used. EER never used to calculate calories
for today.
#### Using BMR Formula
Fitbit uses the standard MD Mifflin-St Jeor equation:
#### EER Formula (TEE total energy expenditure)
The EER Formula is based on
<http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2006/oct/pdf/06_0034.pdf>, which in turn is
based on "Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary reference intakes for energy,
carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids
(macronutrients). Washington (DC): National Academy Press; 2005."
[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309085373&page=204](http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309085373&page=204)
#### MALE-based EER Formula:
#### FEMALE-based EER Formula:
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible

## Additional Information
Access to the Intraday Time Series for personal use (accessing your own data)
is available through the "Personal" App Type.
**Restriction** : Heart Rate Intraday data cannot be retrieved for more than a
24 hour period. Any requests that expand over a 24 hour period will result
with the summary data for the date range specified.
The heart rate intraday time series data is returned in the format requested.
The endpoint mimics the Get Heart Rate Time Series endpoints. If your
application has the appropriate access, your calls to a time series endpoint
for a specific day (by using start and end dates on the same day or a period
of 24 hours), the response will include extended intraday values with
1-second, 1-minute, 5-minute or 15-minute detail level for that day. Unlike
other time series calls that allow fetching data of other users, intraday data
is available only for and to the authorized user.
The "1sec" detail-level may not always return data in 1 second sampling
outside of a recorded exercise. Sampling is more granular during exercise to
provide accuracy. To fetch the granular heart rate during an exercise, query
data using the [GET Activity TCX endpoint](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-tcx/).
### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

## Additional Information
### Displaying VO2 Max data
The cardio fitness score is calculated every time the person exercises. A
user’s cardio fitness score is determined by their resting heart rate, age,
gender, weight, and other personal information. The user’s cardio fitness
score will be shown as a range unless the user uses GPS for runs, in which
case it will be returned as a single numeric value. For more information, see
[What is My Cardio Score?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237924).
### Subscription Support for Cardio Fitness Score (VO2 Max)
VO2 Max does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since VO2 Max is
recorded during exercise, the activity notification arrival time can be used
to estimate when the VO2 max data will be available. For more information, see
[Displaying V02 Max data](/build/reference/web-api/cardio-fitness-score/get-
vo2max-summary-by-date/#Displaying-VO2-Max-data). For applications that do not
track activity, or cannot retrieve activity data, we recommend querying theVO2
max data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available (e.g. 12
noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The VO2 Max endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. For more
information, see [Rate Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/application-design/#Rate-Limits).
### Device compatibility
VO2 Max data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support VO2 Max data collection. For more
information, see the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports VO2 Max.

AFib can have serious health effects. You should contact your doctor.
  * **Normal sinus rhythm (NSR)** : Your heart rhythm appears normal. It doesn’t show signs of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm.
  * **Inconclusive** : If your heart rate is over 120 bpm or under 50 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. There are many possible reasons for getting an inconclusive result, but common causes are moving too much during the assessment, not resting git stat your hands on a table, or other arrhythmia.
  * **Inconclusive: High heart rate** : If your heart rate is over 120 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. Heart rate can be high for many reasons, such as: recent exercise, stress, nervousness, alcohol, dehydration, infection, AFib, or other arrhythmia.
  * **Inconclusive: Low heart rate** : If your heart rate is under 50 bpm, the Fitbit ECG app can’t assess your heart rhythm. Heart rate can be low for many reasons, such as: taking certain medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, having excellent aerobic fitness, or other arrhythmia.
### Subscription Support for ECG
ECG does not support subscription notifications (webhooks). We recommend
querying ECG data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available
(e.g. 12 noon and midnight). However, the frequency or rate at which you query
ECG data should be based on your specific use cases and with this in mind.
### Rate limit

# Get SpO2 Intraday by Interval
This endpoint returns the SpO2 intraday data for a specified date range. SpO2
applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep”, which is the longest single
period of time asleep on a given date. Spo2 values are calculated on a
5-minute exponentially-moving average.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For example, if you
request SpO2 levels for 2021-12-22, it may include measurements that were
taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user fell asleep.
The data returned includes the percentage value of SpO2 in your bloodstream
and an accurate timestamp for that measurement. It also uses

## Additional Information
Interval Intraday values reflect SpO2 measurement taken for periods of sleep
between two dates. For most users, intraday values will span multiple dates to
account for SpO2 levels on the date at which the summary was provided, and
SpO2 levels during the previous night’s sleep.
Keep in mind, the intraday intervals have a maximum date range of 30 days.
Entering a date range that exceeds 30 days will return a 400 Bad Request
response code.
### Collecting SpO2 data
SpO2 data is collected when the user is in an extended period of sleep. There
are many factors that can affect a user’s SpO2 value. Recording the data while
a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect SpO2 data. An extended sleep period is considered to be at least 3
hours of quality sleep. In addition, data is only processed when the user is
still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can
prevent SpO2 data from processing. See help article [How do I track blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2) with my Fitbit
device?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226120) for more
information on SpO2 data processing on the Fitbit device.
The device stops collecting SpO2 data after it determines the user is awake,
typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their device, we
will begin processing the SpO2 data for that sleep period. It can take up to 1
hour for the SpO2 data to be processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for SpO2
SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

## Additional Information
Intraday values reflect SpO2 measurement taken for a period of sleep. For most
users, intraday values will span multiple dates to account for SpO2 levels on
the date at which the summary was provided, and SpO2 levels during the
previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting SpO2 data
SpO2 data is collected when the user is in an extended period of sleep. There
are many factors that can affect a user’s SpO2 value. Recording the data while
a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect SpO2 data. An extended sleep period is considered to be at least 3
hours of quality sleep. In addition, data is only processed when the user is
still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can
prevent SpO2 data from processing. See help article [How do I track blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2) with my Fitbit
device?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226120) for more
information on SpO2 data processing on the Fitbit device.
The device stops collecting SpO2 data after it determines the user is awake,
typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their device, we
will begin processing the SpO2 data for that sleep period. It can take up to 1
hour for the SpO2 data to be processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for SpO2
SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

## Additional Information
TCX returns GPS and heart rate data which are tied to the GPS data points. If
you only want heart rate, see [Heart Rate Intraday Time
Series](/build/reference/web-api/intraday/).
To retrieve the TCX data without GPS data, use the endpoint's query parameter
`includePartialTCX=true`. If the exercise does not contain GPS data, the
lowest heart rate granularity available is 1 minute.
#### Finding an activity's "log id"
The activity's log-id can be found 2 ways:
  * Programmatically, execute the [Get Activity Log List](/build/reference/web-api/activity/get-activity-log-list/) endpoint. Get the value of the `logId` element for each exercise returned.
  * Non-programmatically, find the list of activity logs in the Fitbit web application. Click on the "View Details" button next to each activity. The activity log ID will be displayed in the URL, e.g. 213560689 in https://[www.fitbit.com/activities/exercise/213560689](http://www.fitbit.com/activities/exercise/213560689).
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

foods/), or [Frequent](/build/reference/web-api/nutrition/get-frequent-foods/)
food or by making a query to [Search Foods](/build/reference/web-
api/nutrition/search-foods/) endpoint.
These are the IDs of units that apply to the favorite food. The application
will refer to the complete list of units retrieved previously to get and
display to the user the unit name or plural name for each unit ID on food-
specific list.

## Additional Information
### Intraday data response frequency
Active Zone Minute response data is returned every 1 minute, 5 minutes or 15
minutes. This applies exclusively to the intraday endpoints.
### Subscription support for AZM
Active Zone Minutes does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-
api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since AZM
is recorded during normal activity, the activity notification arrival time can
be used to estimate when changes to the AZM data is available.
### Rate limit
The AZM endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
AZM data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support AZM data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports AZM.

## Additional Information
### Displaying VO2 Max data
The cardio fitness score is calculated every time the person exercises. A
user’s cardio fitness score is determined by their resting heart rate, age,
gender, weight, and other personal information. The user’s cardio fitness
score will be shown as a range unless the user uses GPS for runs, in which
case it will be returned as a single numeric value. For more information, see
[What is My Cardio Score?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237924).
### Subscription Support for Cardio Fitness Score (VO2 Max)
VO2 Max does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since VO2 Max is
recorded during exercise, the activity notification arrival time can be used
to estimate when the V02 max data will be available. For more information, see
[Displaying V02 Max data](/build/reference/web-api/cardio-fitness-score/get-
vo2max-summary-by-date/#Displaying-VO2-Max-data). For applications that do not
track activity, or cannot retrieve activity data, we recommend querying the
V02 max data once or twice a day to determine if new data is available (e.g.
12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The VO2 Max endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. For more
information, see [Rate Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/application-design/#Rate-Limits).
### Device compatibility
VO2 Max data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support VO2 Max data collection. For more
information, see the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports VO2 Max.

# Get SpO2 Summary by Date
This endpoint returns the SpO2 summary data for a single date. SpO2 applies
specifically to a user’s “main sleep”, which is the longest single period of
time asleep on a given date.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For example, if you
request SpO2 levels for 2021-12-22, it may include measurements that were
taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user fell asleep.
The data returned includes average, minimum, and maximum SpO2 levels. It uses
[units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Unit-
Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.
**Scope:** _oxygen_saturation_

## Additional Information
The Single Date Summary value does not apply to a single date, necessarily,
but to an SpO2 measurement taken during a period of sleep. For most users,
this will span two dates to account for SpO2 levels on the date at which the
summary was provided, and SpO2 levels during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting SpO2 data
SpO2 data is collected when the user is in an extended period of sleep. There
are many factors that can affect a user’s SpO2 value. Recording the data while
a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect SpO2 data. An extended sleep period is considered to be at least 3
hours of quality sleep. In addition, data is only processed when the user is
still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can
prevent SpO2 data from processing. See help article [How do I track blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2) with my Fitbit
device?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226120) for more
information on SpO2 data processing on the Fitbit device.
The device stops collecting SpO2 data after it determines the user is awake,
typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their device, we
will begin processing the SpO2 data for that sleep period. It can take up to 1
hour for the SpO2 data to be processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for SpO2
SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

## Additional Information
The response uses the measurement units as defined in the unit system, which
corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
#### Considerations
  * Only the current goals are returned.
  * Floors goal only returned for users who currently or have previously paired a Fitbit device with an altimeter.
  * Calories out goal represents either dynamic daily target from the Premium trainer plan or manual calorie burn goal.
The default daily goal values are:
  * 10 floors;
  * 30 active minutes; and
  * Calories out is user specific, which accounts for BMR.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.

## Additional Information
The data is returned in the format requested using units in the unit system
which corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
Activity statistics includes Lifetime and Best achievement values from the My
Achievements tile on the website dashboard. Response contains both statistics
from the tracker device and total numbers including tracker data and manual
activity log entries as seen on the Fitbit website dashboard.
The Fitbit user's `My Achievements (Friends or Anyone)` privacy permission
grants access to user's resource.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.

# Get SpO2 Summary by Interval
This endpoint returns the SpO2 summary data for a specified date range. SpO2
applies specifically to a user’s “main sleep”, which is the longest single
period of time asleep on a given date.
The measurement is provided at the end of a period of sleep. The data returned
usually reflects a sleep period that began the day before. For example, if you
request SpO2 levels for 2021-12-22, it may include measurements that were
taken the previous night on 2021-12-21 when the user fell asleep.
The data returned includes average, minimum, and maximum SpO2 levels. It uses
[units](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Unit-
Systems) that correspond to the Accept-Language header provided.
**Scope:** _oxygen_saturation_

## Additional Information
The Interval Summary values reflect SpO2 measurements taken for sleep periods
between two dates. For most users, interval summaries may span multiple dates
to account for SpO2 levels on the date at which the summary was provided, and
SpO2 levels during the previous night’s sleep.
### Collecting SpO2 data
SpO2 data is collected when the user is in an extended period of sleep. There
are many factors that can affect a user’s SpO2 value. Recording the data while
a person is asleep allows the Fitbit device to correctly and accurately
collect SpO2 data. An extended sleep period is considered to be at least 3
hours of quality sleep. In addition, data is only processed when the user is
still. If a user moves too much or their sleep session is too short, this can
prevent SpO2 data from processing. See help article [How do I track blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2) with my Fitbit
device?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226120) for more
information on SpO2 data processing on the Fitbit device.
The device stops collecting SpO2 data after it determines the user is awake,
typically through physical movements. Once the user syncs their device, we
will begin processing the SpO2 data for that sleep period. It can take up to 1
hour for the SpO2 data to be processed and made available to download.
### Subscription Support for SpO2
SpO2 does not support [subscription](/build/reference/web-api/developer-
guide/using-subscriptions/) notifications (webhooks). Since SpO2 is recorded
during periods of sleep, the sleep notification arrival time can be used to
estimate when the SpO2 data will be available (See the "Collecting Data"
section). For applications that do not track sleep, or cannot retrieve sleep
data, we recommend querying the SpO2 data once or twice a day to determine if
new data is available (e.g. 12 noon and midnight).
### Rate limit
The SpO2 endpoints are bound by our standard rate limit. See [Rate
Limits](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Rate-
Limits).
### Device compatibility
The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.
Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.
### Measurement units
SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

## Additional Information
The activity log entries for a given day are displayed in the format requested
using units in the unit system corresponding to the Accept-Language header
provided.
#### Considerations
  * User data is only available since the user's join date or the first log entry date for the requested collection.
  * The tracker/... resource represents the daily activity values logged by the tracker device only, excluding manual activity log entires.
  * The tracker/calories resource does not include the Estimated Energy Requirement for calories estimation (EER) calculations for any dates even if they are turned on for the user's profile and use BMR level instead.
  * Elevation time series (/elevation, /floors) are only available for users with compatible trackers.
  * The activities collection are maintained for backwards compatible resource URLs (e.g. (activities/log/calories)).

**Calorie Time Series Differences**
  * **calories** \- The top level time series for calories burned inclusive of BMR, tracked activity, and manually logged activities.
  * **caloriesBMR** \- Value includes only [BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) calories.
  * **activityCalories** \- The number of calories burned during the day for periods of time when the user was active above sedentary level. This value is calculated minute by minute for minutes that fall within this criteria. This includes activity burned calories and BMR.
  * **tracker/calories** \- Calories burned inclusive of BMR according to movement captured by a Fitbit tracker.
  * **tracker/activityCalories** \- Calculated similarly to _activityCalories_ , but uses only tracker data. Manually logged activities are excluded.
### Distance, pace and speed
The Fitbit devices use the following formulas to calculate distance, pace and
speed. Please note, stride length is approximated by the person's height and
gender.
`distance = steps * stride length`
`pace = time(sec) / distance`
`speed = distance / time(hour)`
Daily activity summary and auto-detected exercises' (recorded using Smart
Track) distance are estimated values based on steps and stride length. Devices
that support on-device or connected GPS will record distance, pace and speed
from the GPS data when the exercise is initiated using the on-device Exercise
application. If the person begins moving before receiving a GPS signal, steps
and stride length are used to calculate distance until the GPS connects.
Intraday distance values, returned by the Intraday endpoints or Activity TCX
endpoint, can be more accurate since they use the GPS data. To determine how
the exercise was recorded, see [ "logType" values](/build/reference/web-
api/activity/get-activity-log-list/#logType-values).
Some people have noticed that the standard formula for calculating pace and
speed doesn't always provide accurate results. That's because pace and speed
are calculated from the GPS data, while the total distance is an approximate
value based on how the tracker calculates distance (GPS vs steps & stride
length). The mobile application duplicates the tracker distance value by
displaying the exercise summary view. This is done to provide a better user
experience for the consumer. When the user drills down into the exercise
details, like data charts or maps, they should see the more accurate data
coming from the GPS or Intraday data.
Developers who need to display the most accurate distance values, we suggest
using only the intraday distance data points instead of the activity summary.
See [ How does my Fitbit device calcuate my daily
activity?](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237111) for more
information.
### Webhook notifications
The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.
The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

### Resting Heart Rate
Resting heart rate is a measurement of how many times the person’s heart beats
per minute when completely at rest. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from
60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. The best
time to get an accurate resting heart rate reading is while the person is
asleep. To calculate resting heart rate, the device takes the heart rate
measurements throughout the day and focuses on periods when the person is
still and well-rested, with a priority for during sleep measurements. If there
isn't enough data, a resting heart rate value won't be available for that day.

## Additional Information
The authenticated owner receives all values in the response body. The
authenticated user's access to other users' data is subject to those users'
privacy settings. To retrieve the profile information of the authenticated
owner's friends, use the [Get Friends endpoint](/build/reference/web-
api/friends/get-friends). Numerical values are returned in the unit system
specified in the Accept-Language header.
**Considerations**
  1. The fullName field is present at all times. It contains one of the following:
     * The user's fullName.
     * A portion of user's email address before the at sign, "@". This is used in the case where the fullName field is empty.
  2. The Units fields (distanceUnit, glucoseUnit, etc.) represent the default unit settings configured for the user. These fields are used as the default for all other body measurements (such as neck, bicep, etc.).
  3. The locale field indicates the locale website version currently used (such as en_US, en_GB, etc.).

## Additional Information
### Device support
The Fitbit devices have the ability to set an alarm. Older devices whose
alarms are configured in the mobile application support the create, delete,
get and update alarm endpoints. Newer devices, listed in this help article
<https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14226604>, contain an on-device
alarm application, and do not support the alarm endpoints. The alarms for
these devices can only be set on the device itself.
Setting an alarm without a recurring schedule is intended for next day
purposes only.

## Output Indicator
Ensure that, except for the parts modified to follow the latest specifications, the structure and format of the code remain identical to the original code. Here, "identical" means that there should be no differences (diff) whatsoever, including in indentation, spaces, line breaks, and code structure, which should all be exactly the same as the original.
If there are any changes beyond the modified sections, this is considered incorrect.
Also, verify that the modified code conforms to the latest specifications.
